I went to one of Hillary’s rallies to see the debacle for myself. She didn’t answer a damn question. Not one. A simple 30m speech to approximately 300 people in a small gym room (think 6 rows of 50 seats in a semi circle) and another 500 or so people had to sit in an auditorium and watch her speech on TV. They traveled from all over and had to watch her on TV. So fucking sad.
