We need to stop eating our own young, y’all. When we have a candidate, WE HAVE TO VOTE FOR THEM. I live in Mississippi, but you can be damn sure I took my happy ass to the polls and voted for HRC. I was 100% certain she’d lose in my state and 100% certain she’d win in an electoral landslide. I showed up to vote anyway. She may not have been who I wanted, but she had a more liberal platform than what we all knew President Trump would put forward. How many people in Michigan, Ohio, Florida, and Pennsylvania didn’t vote because they “knew” she was gonna win?
