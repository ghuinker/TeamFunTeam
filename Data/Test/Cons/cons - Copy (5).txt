I tried to say the same my friend but I was a bit adversarial about it. We are still leaving huge paper trails of a bill no one read except the lines that matter to them. We should be demanding shorter and less legalise document that can be easily scrolled from a secured blackberry or tablet. The paper trail can start after its been read and understood by all parties involved.
