Autists digging up some really interesting language in the bill.

$270 million for trials

Tens of millions for buildings holding people for trials

Sorry I'm at work or would link

Edit for language:

This is money for Expenses of witnesses. IMO this is better than for trials. That's a lot of witnesses.

Also quit chimping out. Omnibus is not a budget. Obama cared fuckall about what the Omnibus said and did what he wanted. You think GEOTUS doesn't know this, and won't do the same?

One last thing. The FUCKING GOP AND THE DEMS held our military hostage to enrich their fucking donors and lobbyists, and we're pissed at Trump? Are we going to curl up and die at the first defeat? We aren't pede's if that's the case. HOLLOW FANGS! MAGA! BURN EM ALL DOWN!
