The iPhone and Microsoft word and the like are the only thing the US needs to promote democracy across the world. The innovation and creation of great products from a free and open society is like crack cocaine to shit hole commie countries. Works better than any 200 million dollar campaign engineered by congress. Best of all it's free to the US tax payer. Let our market do it's thing. Spend that 200 mil in country!!!!!
