What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.(1) in turning over your rant to the local police and the FBI.  Why? As there are several death threats in it, and I value my life dearly.  I will be pursuing criminal charges to the fullest extent the law allows.(2) I am going to subpoena Reddit or your IP address and regular account user name.  I will ask that you be banded from the entire site permanently.  If they chose to not do this I will name Reddit in the same civil lawsuit I intend on filing against you for mental damages.(3) when the police, the FBI, and Reddit all laugh... I am going to the news.  And trust me the news has a thing for cyber bullying right now.  And while I am a man of large stature, I'd love to watch you e eaten alive in the court of public opinion.So here is it, your last chance; give me your full legal name, give me your current address, give me your telephone number...  These will only be used, and I swear on my children, in pending litigation against you... If you don't stop.  If you want to continue this, you'll be responsible for your own undoing.You have no idea the atrocities I am capable of.  If you truly knew me, you would have never started this. If you have a CCW, this is good.  If you carry a knife, even better.  You'll need them if you intend on stopping a man of my caliber.  And aim high, as that's the only way you'll ever stop me.My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the results tonight. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is he losing? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want Bernie to be president and fix this broken country. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought he was polling well for California???? This is so fucked.Holy shit. My boss came into my server room to bring me a plate of subpoenas and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of subpoenas out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to post on Reddit about committing a felony with my boss but I'm literally in shock from sucking at my job. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is she napping? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a BleachBit to believe in. I want anyone to help me hide this illegal server. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought she said at this point what does it matter???? This is so fucked.You are all hilarious and I love you for so many reasons, not least of which is your crazy talk. Proud to maga by your side.I don’t give a fuck who you are or where you live. You can count on me to be there to bring your fucking life to a hellish end. I’ll put you in so much fucking pain that it’ll make Jesus being nailed to a cross in the desert look like a fucking back massage on a tropical island. I don’t give a fuck how many reps you have or how tough you are IRL, how well you can fight, or how many fucking guns you own to protect yourself. I’ll fucking show up at your house when you aren’t home. I’ll turn all the lights on in your house, leave all the water running, open your fridge door and not close it, and turn your gas stove burners on and let them waste gas. You’re going to start stressing the fuck out, your blood pressure will triple, and you’ll have a fucking heart attack. You’ll go to the hospital for a heart operation, and the last thing you’ll see when you’re being put under in the operating room is me hovering above you, dressed like a doctor. When you wake up after being operated on, wondering what ticking time bomb is in your chest waiting to go off. You’ll recover fully from your heart surgery. And when you walk out the front door of the hospital to go home I’ll run you over with my fucking car out of no where and kill you. I just want you to know how easily I could fucking destroy your pathetic excuse of a life, but how I’d rather go to a great fuckng length to make sure your last remaining days are spent in a living, breathing fucking hell. It’s too late to save yourself, but don’t bother committing suicide either… I’ll fucking resuscitate you and kill you again myself you bitch-faced phaggot. Welcome to hell, population: you.I felt like a happy copypasta in the midst of angry ones. I made appropriate edits to it to fit the sub.You absolute sack of shit, why did you have to remind me of this god awful fan-fiction. I hate you and demand you get banned.That was nearly 10 years ago. Katy is legal age now. Just think about that for a while. Does that make you feel better? xdDo you remember rich raven? No? I do. You probably don't remember depression dog, crazy girlfriend praying mantis, introspective pug, or friendzone Johnny either. I remember all of them. In fact, you have only submitted two posts to adviceanimals garnering a total of just 4 points and have not commented there any time recently. So please, respect my judgement regarding the direction of the subreddit and the integrity of posts I have held dear to my heart for nearly 7 years but you have no strong feelings for. Let me dive into your mind and pull out a theory of why this infuriates you. Could it be that focusing so much on people who "died for your country" can have the nasty effect that it places the dead (whom you may know or be related to or might be similar to you in some way) on "our side" and the killers "their side" and makes it really easy to manipulate people to perpetuate war around the world? Could it be because people seldom tend to focus on the veterans who are still alive and suffering from PTSD or drug addiction or are homeless or penniless or can't even function like normal members of society anymore because they were treated as disposable objects for some smirky political dipshit who often couldn't care less what happens to them as long as they get to eat sushi out of a hooker's ass?Now don't get me wrong, there is some cultural value in looking back at the soldiers who have died and reflecting on it, but a) countries tend to have a whole day for that every year and b) why do I have the sneaking suspicion this person wants to honor those dead soldiers? Honor in war is a stupid idea. No matter what you're righting for, it is not honorable to gut somebody so their viscera falls out and then stab them in the neck to get the job done. It is not honorable to sit behind a computer blowing up random people with drones. It is not honorable to be forced to piss and shit in a foxhole while hell on Earth erupts all round you because the political powers that be couldn't get along at the fucking kiddy table. The reason it is sad and despicable and inexcusable is not for honor, but for the disgrace and tragedy that dying in such ignoble ways for such ignoble reasons is something that still continues to happen.  Perhaps it's because if the kind of household this son is being raised in, one day when he's 18, he might be tricked into joining either the ranks of soldiers who are celebrated for dying in horror and agony or the ranks of veterans who are often completely shit upon by their governments for some bullshit war that probably didn't need to be fought anyway. sweetie, you are literally so out of line it’s fucking unbelievable. i could drag you so hard right now but i know you’ll just end up crying. i’ve roasted you before and you know it. chances are you’ll just say i bullied you because you’re gay and have different skin. talk shit get hit, you don’t wanna mess with me kiddo; i’ve got a black belt.
i know threats are fucked up but that’s all i’ve been receiving all day, probably from her royal hoodrat olive and all of her nasty friends. but you can gang up on me and make fun of me for being goth all you want. i’ve been hurt a lot. my first boyfriend cheated on me, my dad screams if i forget to do my chores, and there are some days i don’t even want to get out of bed in the mornings.
i’m a jaded teenage girl. i’ve been through shit that you wouldn’t even dream of. you think your life is hard? try asking the cutest guy in your grade out in the middle of the cafeteria only to find out he has a fucking girlfriend. you don’t know my life or my story so keep my name out of your nasty mouth. life is a battlefield and it looks like i’ve already won.You are all hilarious and I love you for so many reasons, not least of which is your crazy talk. Proud to maga by your side.You are all hilarious and I love you for so many reasons, not least of which is your crazy talk. Proud to maga by your side.Don't forget the ammo stashes that show up everywhere. Shit's getting real when that happens, folks. Being a private investigator is far from glamorous. I spend most of my hours in a car that reeks of cigarettes, either freezing or sweating my butt off because I don't make enough to keep the engine running. It's not exciting, either. I've never chased anyone down back alleys or been in a dramatic gunfight. There was one case, however, that still haunts me to this day.It was almost five o'clock on the night before Christmas Eve. I should have left already; I had an exotic minx waiting for me with a bottle of top-shelf bourbon, but I was taking the next week off and I wanted to get caught up on some paperwork. Just as I was grabbing my coat and hat, the phone on my desk rang. If I hadn't let my assistant leave early, she would have taken a message for me that I wouldn't have seen it until next year. I hesitated for a moment, longing for my office door, when a thought of overdue bills guilted me into answering.The man was using a voice modulator, and caller ID was blocked. He called himself Mr. P, and wanted my help taking down a corrupt politician. I was suspicious, but the man told me there was an advance payment waiting for me in my mailbin. He said there would be further instructions and wished me a Merry Christmas. Something didn't feel right, but sure enough, there was an envelope of cash waiting for me. It was a Merry Christmas, indeed.I didn't hear back from Mr. P until almost Febuary. I was to retrieve a dropoff. It was supposed to be simple, but as an investigator, I don't like being kept in the dark. I staked out the dropoff point and waited for Mr. P to bring the package. I was able to identify the shifty man immediately, and confronted him. I explained that I respect his right to anonymity, but that we had to have a relationship built on trust. To my surprise, the man wasn't my employer, but just some college loser who found a job on Craigslist. Someone who just signed his correspondence with a K paid him to deliver a suitcase. The kid was obviously freaked out and I could tell he knew nothing, so I accepted the suitcase and let him scram.So Mr. P was using double blind-proxies, ensuring nothing could be traced back to him. Very professional. The suitcase was locked with a simple three-digit combination, so I had no choice but to take it back to the office and play the waiting game again. I wouldn't be waiting long. I walked back to my car and found it ticketed. I pulled the small scrap of paper out from under my wiper blade and read it. "777 - Mr. P"In the safety of my office, I opened the suitcase. Apparently I was going to have a happy Valentine's Day, too, because the first thing I saw was a bundle of 100's totaling a cool ten grand. Also inside was a plane ticket to Palm Beach, FL, a thumb drive, and - strangest of all - a pack of Twinkies. I received another call with instructions. Though it was the same modulated voice with the same blocked number, the called denied that he was Mr. P. I never did figure this part out, and Mr. Miller didn't offer any explanation, but by this time I was too caught up in the motions to change course now. I had just under 2 hours to make my flight.I was still dressed for New York winter, so I found myself sweating like a pig outside the PBIA terminal. I sat on that bench for an uncomfortable amount of time. When the sun was nearly set, I was approached by a police officer. I know some people are unnerved by cops, but I've worked with law enforcement my whole life, so I was prepared to defuse any situation that might arise. To my surprise, the officer only handed me a slip of paper. "Don says thanks," he said, and turned to walk back to the terminal. You need a sharp eye in my profession, so while it was a brief, I caught a glimpse of the officer’s shoulder patch. The man served in a small South Carolina town. What was going on?The slip of paper had a local address and some sort of code name written on it. When I knocked, a sweet lady in her fifties opened the door. Not what I was expecting. "Uh, is Big Lee here?" I asked, lamely. "Oh, you're one of Lee's friends? That's great! He never gets much company these days. He's right downstairs." The mom led me to the basement door. I admit I was creeped out by her overzealous charm, but it turned out she was just happy for her son.Now, nothing could prepare me for what I found in the basement. I caught a whiff of stench at the top of the stairs, and it became more pungent with every step. The floor was covered in greasy fast food wrappers, and every square inch of dresser- and table-top was stacked with empty Big Gulp cups, chicken nugget boxes, and Twinkie wrappers. "Are those for me?" a slurred voice asked. In the middle of the room was a bed with a shirtless man who must have weighted 400lbs. He held a piece of pizza in one limp wrist, while the other hand worked the mouse of a terminal with six monitors. Countless glow-in-the-dark plastic stars stuck on the dropdown ceiling cast a sickly green glow on his clammy skin. I looked at the Twinkies in my hand and tossed them in his direction."I go by Big Lee. Julian said you needed a secure link to upload a thumb drive. Some data that needs to be kept safe until later this year." It was another name I never heard. Another proxy, surely. The handoff went fine and I got out of there as quickly as I could. Back home again, I waited for months, expecting further instructions, but they never came. I had to resign to myself that I was just a blind agent myself, and that I'd never have the whole story. Since then the entire year has flown past with no contact until last week. There were no more instructions, only a generic thank you card with a smiling frog on the front. The card was unsigned, but I think I know who sent it.You are all hilarious and I love you for so many reasons, not least of which is your crazy talk. Proud to maga by your side.More proof that Trump and Pence have altered the timeline. Thanks for sharing brave sir.  I certainly Hope you stay away from the gym for a few weeks.And Hillary wouldn't even give them $15 an hour, $12 was enough. That's tough when your spend $250 a month on Mountain Dew. And you others can't go to Starbucks and buy their Venti Mocha frappachino, Iced, Sugar-Free, Vanilla Latte With Soy Milk on $12 an hour?!They eat David Brock's dandruff.

When you wake up after being operated on, wondering what ticking time bomb is in your chest waiting to go off. You’ll recover fully from your heart surgery. And when you walk out the front door of the hospital to go home I’ll run you over with my fucking car out of no where and kill you. I just want you to know how easily I could fucking destroy your pathetic excuse of a life, but how I’d rather go to a great fuckng length to make sure your last remaining days are spent in a living, breathing fucking hell. It’s too late to save yourself, but don’t bother committing suicide either… I’ll fucking resuscitate you and kill you again myself you bitch-faced phaggot. Welcome to hell, population: you.I felt like a happy copypasta in the midst of angry ones. I made appropriate edits to it to fit the sub.You absolute sack of shit, why did you have to remind me of this god awful fan-fiction. I hate you and demand you get banned.That was nearly 10 years ago. Katy is legal age now. Just think about that for a while. Does that make you feel better? xdDo you remember rich raven? No? I do. You probably don't remember depression dog, crazy girlfriend praying mantis, introspective pug, or friendzone Johnny either. I remember all of them. In fact, you have only submitted two posts to adviceanimals garnering a total of just 4 points and have not commented there any time recently. So please, respect my judgement regarding the direction of the subreddit and the integrity of posts I have held dear to my heart for nearly 7 years but you have no strong feelings for. Let me dive into your mind and pull out a theory of why this infuriates you. Could it be that focusing so much on people who "died for your country" can have the nasty effect that it places the dead (whom you may know or be related to or might be similar to you in some way) on "our side" and the killers "their side" and makes it really easy to manipulate people to perpetuate war around the world? Could it be because people seldom tend to focus on the veterans who are still alive and suffering from PTSD or drug addiction or are homeless or penniless or can't even function like normal members of society anymore because they were treated as disposable objects for some smirky political dipshit who often couldn't care less what happens to them as long as they get to eat sushi out of a hooker's ass?Now don't get me wrong, there is some cultural value in looking back at the soldiers who have died and reflecting on it, but a) countries tend to have a whole day for that every year and b) why do I have the sneaking suspicion this person wants to honor those dead soldiers? Honor in war is a stupid idea. No matter what you're righting for, it is not honorable to gut somebody so their viscera falls out and then stab them in the neck to get the job done. It is not honorable to sit behind a computer blowing up random people with drones. It is not honorable to be forced to piss and shit in a foxhole while hell on Earth erupts all round you because the political powers that be couldn't get along at the fucking kiddy table. The reason it is sad and despicable and inexcusable is not for honor, but for the disgrace and tragedy that dying in such ignoble ways for such ignoble reasons is something that still continues to happen.  Perhaps it's because if the kind of household this son is being raised in, one day when he's 18, he might be tricked into joining either the ranks of soldiers who are celebrated for dying in horror and agony or the ranks of veterans who are often completely shit upon by their governments for some bullshit war that probably didn't need to be fought anyway. sweetie, you are literally so out of line it’s fucking unbelievable. i could drag you so hard right now but i know you’ll just end up crying. i’ve roasted you before and you know it. chances are you’ll just say i bullied you because you’re gay and have different skin. talk shit get hit, you don’t wanna mess with me kiddo; i’ve got a black belt.
i know threats are fucked up but that’s all i’ve been receiving all day, probably from her royal hoodrat olive and all of her nasty friends. but you can gang up on me and make fun of me for being goth all you want. i’ve been hurt a lot. my first boyfriend cheated on me, my dad screams if i forget to do my chores, and there are some days i don’t even want to get out of bed in the mornings.
i’m a jaded teenage girl. i’ve been through shit that you wouldn’t even dream of. you think your life is hard? try asking the cutest guy in your grade out in the middle of the cafeteria only to find out he has a fucking girlfriend. you don’t know my life or my story so keep my name out of your nasty mouth. life is a battlefield and it looks like i’ve already won.You are all hilarious and I love you for so many reasons, not least of which is your crazy talk. Proud to maga by your side.You are all hilarious and I love you for so many reasons, not least of which is your crazy talk. Proud to maga by your side.(1) in turning over your rant to the local police and the FBI.  Why? As there are several death threats in it, and I value my life dearly.  I will be pursuing criminal charges to the fullest extent the law allows.(2) I am going to subpoena Reddit or your IP address and regular account user name.  I will ask that you be banded from the entire site permanently.  If they chose to not do this I will name Reddit in the same civil lawsuit I intend on filing against you for mental damages.(3) when the police, the FBI, and Reddit all laugh... I am going to the news.  And trust me the news has a thing for cyber bullying right now.

These will only be used, and I swear on my children, in pending litigation against you... If you don't stop.  If you want to continue this, you'll be responsible for your own undoing.You have no idea the atrocities I am capable of.  If you truly knew me, you would have never started this. If you have a CCW, this is good.  If you carry a knife, even better.  You'll need them if you intend on stopping a man of my caliber.  And aim high, as that's the only way you'll ever stop me.My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the results tonight. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is he losing? This can't be happening.

This is so fucked.I don’t give a fuck who you are or where you live. You can count on me to be there to bring your fucking life to a hellish end. I’ll put you in so much fucking pain that it’ll make Jesus being nailed to a cross in the desert look like a fucking back massage on a tropical island. I don’t give a fuck how many reps you have or how tough you are IRL, how well you can fight, or how many fucking guns you own to protect yourself. I’ll fucking show up at your house when you aren’t home. I’ll turn all the lights on in your house, leave all the water running, open your fridge door and not close it, and turn your gas stove burners on and let them waste gas. You’re going to start stressing the fuck out, your blood pressure will triple, and you’ll have a fucking heart attack.

Proud to maga by your side.I felt like a happy copypasta in the midst of angry ones. I made appropriate edits to it to fit the sub.Being a private investigator is far from glamorous. I spend most of my hours in a car that reeks of cigarettes, either freezing or sweating my butt off because I don't make enough to keep the engine running. It's not exciting, either. I've never chased anyone down back alleys or been in a dramatic gunfight. There was one case, however, that still haunts me to this day.It was almost five o'clock on the night before Christmas Eve. I should have left already; I had an exotic minx waiting for me with a bottle of top-shelf bourbon, but I was taking the next week off and I wanted to get caught up on some paperwork. Just as I was grabbing my coat and hat, the phone on my desk rang. If I hadn't let my assistant leave early, she would have taken a message for me that I wouldn't have seen it until next year. I hesitated for a moment, longing for my office door, when a thought of overdue bills guilted me into answering.The man was using a voice modulator, and caller ID was blocked. He called himself Mr. P, and wanted my help taking down a corrupt politician. I was suspicious, but the man told me there was an advance payment waiting for me in my mailbin. He said there would be further instructions and wished me a Merry Christmas. Something didn't feel right, but sure enough, there was an envelope of cash waiting for me. It was a Merry Christmas, indeed.I didn't hear back from Mr. P until almost Febuary. I was to retrieve a dropoff. It was supposed to be simple, but as an investigator, I don't like being kept in the dark. I staked out the dropoff point and waited for Mr. P to bring the package. I was able to identify the shifty man immediately, and confronted him. I explained that I respect his right to anonymity, but that we had to have a relationship built on trust. To my surprise, the man wasn't my employer, but just some college loser who found a job on Craigslist. Someone who just signed his correspondence with a K paid him to deliver a suitcase. The kid was obviously freaked out and I could tell he knew nothing, so I accepted the suitcase and let him scram.So Mr. P was using double blind-proxies, ensuring nothing could be traced back to him. Very professional. The suitcase was locked with a simple three-digit combination, so I had no choice but to take it back to the office and play the waiting game again. I wouldn't be waiting long. I walked back to my car and found it ticketed. I pulled the small scrap of paper out from under my wiper blade and read it. "777 - Mr. P"In the safety of my office, I opened the suitcase. Apparently I was going to have a happy Valentine's Day, too, because the first thing I saw was a bundle of 100's totaling a cool ten grand. Also inside was a plane ticket to Palm Beach, FL, a thumb drive, and - strangest of all - a pack of Twinkies. I received another call with instructions. Though it was the same modulated voice with the same blocked number, the called denied that he was Mr. P. I never did figure this part out, and Mr. Miller didn't offer any explanation, but by this time I was too caught up in the motions to change course now. I had just under 2 hours to make my flight.I was still dressed for New York winter, so I found myself sweating like a pig outside the PBIA terminal. I sat on that bench for an uncomfortable amount of time. When the sun was nearly set, I was approached by a police officer. I know some people are unnerved by cops, but I've worked with law enforcement my whole life, so I was prepared to defuse any situation that might arise. To my surprise, the officer only handed me a slip of paper. "Don says thanks," he said, and turned to walk back to the terminal. You need a sharp eye in my profession, so while it was a brief, I caught a glimpse of the officer’s shoulder patch. The man served in a small South Carolina town. What was going on?The slip of paper had a local address and some sort of code name written on it. When I knocked, a sweet lady in her fifties opened the door. Not what I was expecting. "Uh, is Big Lee here?" I asked, lamely. "Oh, you're one of Lee's friends? That's great! He never gets much company these days. He's right downstairs." The mom led me to the basement door. I admit I was creeped out by her overzealous charm, but it turned out she was just happy for her son.Now, nothing could prepare me for what I found in the basement. I caught a whiff of stench at the top of the stairs, and it became more pungent with every step. The floor was covered in greasy fast food wrappers, and every square inch of dresser- and table-top was stacked with empty Big Gulp cups, chicken nugget boxes, and Twinkie wrappers. "Are those for me?" a slurred voice asked. In the middle of the room was a bed with a shirtless man who must have weighted 400lbs. He held a piece of pizza in one limp wrist, while the other hand worked the mouse of a terminal with six monitors. Countless glow-in-the-dark plastic stars stuck on the dropdown ceiling cast a sickly green glow on his clammy skin. I looked at the Twinkies in my hand and tossed them in his direction."I go by Big Lee. Julian said you needed a secure link to upload a thumb drive. Some data that needs to be kept safe until later this year." It was another name I never heard. Another proxy, surely. The handoff went fine and I got out of there as quickly as I could. Back home again, I waited for months, expecting further instructions, but they never came. I had to resign to myself that I was just a blind agent myself, and that I'd never have the whole story. Since then the entire year has flown past with no contact until last week. There were no more instructions, only a generic thank you card with a smiling frog on the front. The card was unsigned, but I think I know who sent it.You are all hilarious and I love you for so many reasons, not least of which is your crazy talk. Proud to maga by your side.More proof that Trump and Pence have altered the timeline. Thanks for sharing brave sir.  I certainly Hope you stay away from the gym for a few weeks.And Hillary wouldn't even give them $15 an hour, $12 was enough. That's tough when your spend $250 a month on Mountain Dew.

They try so fucking hard to come across as enlightened that they'll argue over semantics until their tendies get cold and their mom barks at them to move out as she drinks herself under the table because her child is such is an obnoxious parasite.  One semester of psychology doesn't make you a psychologist and your liberal arts degree doesn't make you employable. It makes me happy that other people get as completely rationally angry at these little fucks. They don't deserve to be apart of our modern society...but....our awesome modern society also dictates they do...god..fucking..damn it.I guarantee you the people that did this either were cholos/thug latinos that wish they were black or people affiliated with the church that would benefit from the insurance money. lol, if Bill is wasting his time personally setting fires then he's more of an idiot than any of us ever gave him credit forI became a vegetable, my brain could only handle so much cancer.  Now I sit on the domreddit and make memes all day.  I have mashed potatoes attached to my veins, and Pepsi inserted into my urethra.  Don't be like them.

Now RSBN gets their stream revoked, and we just learned today that Iran is invading US and Europe with the CASH that Obama and Hitlery gave them with the nuclear deal. Boys, get your jammies ready.It sounds like the beginning of jihad to me. And Hillary wants to open the borders? I don't think so...Yeah if it's a fact and has been proven that the Iranian military knew and participated then it's an invasion and there is no way we're not going to war over it. I think Iran is one of the things Trump is a bit misinformed on. It's mostly Iranian money they are unlocking. Iran is problematic but not particularly more or less so than Pakistan or Saudi Arabia. I think unlike Clinton though Trump would be able to establish a more balanced view of the situation. Trump likes to keep an open mind and his options open. Hillary is pathologically stubborn about things such as Syria.The timing of it is a bit dodgy though. They've tried to pin it on Clinton but it seems more like Obama trying to do what he is doing with Cuba probably to earn the noble peace price that no one knows why the hell he won it. For Clinton, buying off or bribing the Iranians to stay out of business when shit goes down in Syria might be of strategic value. It's still very risky though. They could take that money only to turn around and use it to support Russia in a middle eastern war. You can't always buy loyalty and the Iranian's might be in that camp.It's the kind of thing that might be a good thing if there wasn't a ton of other things going on stopping them from concentrating on a good deal for reconciliation with Iran properly. It's just squeezed in.I think Obama gave them a dump truck full of cash to keep them quiet before the election. At this point, I feel Obama should be tried for treason for giving them a dime, and for giving them a path to nukes. Nothing is worse than liberals in office.Well, unfreezing their assets is important when it comes to advancing towards good relations but yes, it seems more like a short term pay off for them to stay out of trouble for a while than a real plan for long term peace. You need to get something substantial, meaningful and that leads to a long term process. What's the timing for crisis point when they limitations expire? Is is near to the next election?They mishandled the same with North Korea ages ago in the opposite way. They unlocked a moderate amount, a few million but they still couldn't get to it. The negotiator for North korea got angry about it basically saying it meant nothing if he didn't have the cash in his hands (it was their own cash as well). Basically he said the US would just keep playing the same card. It was a pointless symbolic gesture.We've never had good relations with Iran. Even that fool came over to NYC for a week, he went right back to Iran and bad-mouthed us the minute someone gave him a mic. I was much more comfy when we had them monitored and in a leash, but Obama just killed us with his stupidity. Strength through weakness is Obama's game.The only reason that was legitimate with Iraq was because they technically started a war of aggression and then lost when we intervened, justifying us in imposing certain conditions on them.I am german too and I am on the same path as you.
Can not wait to see Merkel interacting with the Donald. Germany needs a major shift in it's political landscape. And that shift must be to the right. I wonder how Trump is supposed to help Germany.Especially with the mindset of Germans I know, who think that closing your border and regulating immigration is somehow racist.Trump win will mean that people have a real proof that what they always thought privately is shared by millions of people and that they are allowed to voice their concerns about unchecked mass-immigration, globalism, the death of the nation state etc.I think a Trump presidency will take a lot of wind out of political correctness by simply putting a stop to the PC narrative being shoveled by Obama and Co. from the top down.I absolutely agree. It's one of the many reasons I eventually took a deep breath and hopped on this no brakes train.This is our chance to push back. This can be the turning point for everything. Starting with abandoning PC, we will dismantle more and more of the leftist dominance. And it will be awesome.You mean my flair? I got it from a mod here awhile back. Unfortunately, it's no longer available... Sorry, fam. In case you were wondering, that character is Momiji Inubashiri from Touhou Project.This pains my heart to see a poor, innocent Centipede left out in the cold without such an awesome flair next to their name :(We got you, we won't let you down based Beer Merchcants. We will make Earth great again once we fix ourselves here shortly. Isis won't exist in 2 years once we wipe them off the face of the earth with like a cloth or something. I encourage everyone with a Facebook to go to Hillary's page and look at the comments on her posts. And then go compare that with the comments on President Trump's posts. That's the  incoming landslide.Fellow Germanpede here... What annoys me almost the most is the complete German media establishment smearing Trump since he appeared on their radar (after the landslides in the early primaries). And not a word about how Hillary's crooked behaviour, even now they take the CNN talking points about how 'Democrats have issue with Comey's late involvement', not a word about the content of the emails at all, brushed off in a half sentences as "Republicans claim...". It's like I'm in the bloody twilight zone, even AfD leaning people I know buy into this media brainwashing of Trump is a retard... Though I made some good bets. Also looking forward to read their stories of the impending apocalypse next week, the sweet cocktail of salty tears, their usual Anti-Americanism and then their process of moving through the stages of grief; it'll be Brexit all over again!Thinking of doing a write up over the weekend and forward it to some media contacts or as letters to the editors of these rags; anyone have some good write ups of the Email scandal, it's too much material to sight for a person that actually has a real job too?Now RSBN gets their stream revoked, and we just learned today that Iran is invading US and Europe with the CASH that Obama and Hitlery gave them with the nuclear deal.

 [REDACTED ]I posted some honest respectful questions about hillary and their response was to instantly ban me and respond to my comments after banning me to make it seem like they had the last word, and therefore "winning " in their minds.
Edit: subActually I lied, that's not the way to be likely. But still, fuck those people for being complicit in the crimes of the Dems.I was browsing it for keks earlier and had to resist making a snide comment because I want to go there to brag after election day and getting banned would ruin it. That sub has triggered CTR, a lot of posts are negative 0. I did my part and sent in some emergency UpTrumps. dude, take that link out to that sub before they run to the reddit admins and blow the brigading rape whistleDifference is that I did not personally attack or disrespect anyone all I posted were cold hard factsActually I lied, that's not the way to be likely. But still, fuck those people for being complicit in the crimes of the Dems.I just knocked on the door and there is nobody home, only a couple of little quackers running around quacking.https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5aqvr4/this_is_the_secret_of_the_fbi_tweets_this_is_what/maybe these ctr cucks should realize there own boss doesnt care about them. oh wait that would require them not being fucking idiots What is the next level promotion for a CTR nerd virgin? Do you graduate to bird dog or are bird dogs promoted to CTR? What if CTR pissposter is the end of the line?You lose your virginity and become Foval. Then level up again if you make it a few years without getting arrested. Then you become a senator. Then you get arrested. But no matter what... You always remain a cuckThe next promotion is pumping CO into their corner office at 11pm EST on Tuesday night. Can't have witnesses.We appreciate all the work you guys do around here. 6 more days, and CTR is out of a job. Let's finish strong and MAGA!!!Nov. 9th will be a new "hangover holiday"... we might be hungover from all the winning... then we'll suck it up and get back to winning.Nov. 9th will be a new "hangover holiday"... we might be hungover from all the winning... then we'll suck it up and get back to winning.You guys, hear me out, don't downvote me, I'm a Trump supporter but we will lose the election if WE DON'T ALL GO OUT AND VOTE.CTR pisses me off so much, it should be illegal. It's a form of censorship/bullying/voter suppression.Correct The Record, they're Hillary Clinton (Crooked) SuperPAC, they basically shill for her online and harass/bully people who support Trump.https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5aqvr4/this_is_the_secret_of_the_fbi_tweets_this_is_what/Concern trolling is a very real threat.  The best way to pit a community against each other is concern trolling.  The Snowden leaks had slides from spy agencies and this was one of their methods of subversion.  There is also forum sliding which occurred yesterday but it doesn't work well with reddit due to the voting.  Many of you are probably unaware of subversion tactics so read these:and then later that night someone posted a comment on my most popular video saying it was the worst thing they have ever seen. CTR?LOL CTR virgin faggots.  Get rekt.  Your master is a pedo, child/human trafficker.  DEFEND THAT WHEN IT COMES OUT SCUM BAGS. YOU SHIT, YOU SCUM. Even at 51% downvoted, this thread is still high up. Hillary and her CTR traitors can go fuck themselves. You won't stop the American people.Awesome. Fucking sick of low energy retards getting mad when memes get stickied. Memes got us this far and they are a sign of high energy. The moment we lose our memes we lose the sub. FBI threads are highly valued but the point of stickies here is just to give a boost until it can stand on it's own. There were plenty FBI threads standing.You know what the dumbest thing of all is, with the concern trolls and complaining about stickies (or lack thereof)? The fact that they can scroll down and find the info they were after anyway. They aren't terribly bright.Hey shills, fuck you. You mad hilldog is losing? Well you've had your turn messing up this country. Trump will make it great again. #MAGAWould love to get a CTR insider to spill the beans. In fact I bet there is one or two in there already that are Trump leaning. Come on now, walk into the light :)eat a dick CTR, you cant control free speech.  take some of that money they pay you, and buy yourself a clue, or some dignity.You guys, we need to just vote for Hillary because she's so trustworthy and got dicked by a President, plus, halllllooooooooo, she has a Uterus.They are so triggered that the Redacted mods banned me for nothing today.  Ignore the guy telling me to fuck off and calling me too retarded to know who I'm responding to, but ban the guy stumping him?  Okay.Just imagine how many CTR's were promised positions somewhere in the Shillary army after she rigged the election and are now terrified that they might have to go out and possibly earn an honest living.Fuck them. They are desperade. 
I am a huge supporter from Czech Republic, I can't help Trump by giving a vote, but I will downvote them to fucking hell everytime I see them. And I really really respect and love Donald, so I am quite active. This is war and we will win. JUST 6 MORE DAYS, WE ARE THE HIGH ENERGY. Haha BTFO. :D I am proud Czech and I do love my country and I love America also. My country is doing great. We are not Germany or France. Most of us are not stupid as you, CTR are. Thats why I would vote TRUMP. I see everywhere around what globalism and big level corruption did to Europe. Centipedes, do not let this happen to America!Fucking thank you. All the bitching over what constituted a "real sticky" was starting to piss me off. With the sheer quantity of complaining and concern trolling I knew it had to be CTR.In case actual centipedes were complaining about what was stickied, just chill the fuck out. The FBI info is still getting out and the digging is still being done regardless of whether it's stuck at the top for ten minutes.To say they are CRT shills is ridiculous though, people can have different opinions on what should be stickied.Such a weird topic, I think those that were questioning why the FBI dumps weren't being stickied had every right to tbh. Not sure where the crt shills theory has come from!Thank you for this, I've noticed a huge spike in people calling our every post about how we need to be focused on FBI/Wikileaks/KimDotCom, but you know what, sometimes I want to laugh at a Pepe Meme or oogle a Hottie for Trump (or Ivanka). Not every has to be on blast. 
Keep the positive vibes going brothers and keep the party rolling through November 8th!Every morning on my way to work I roll down my window and yell Pepe to my daughter and she yells Pepe back. I have the best kid folks. The best. Every morning on my way to work I roll down my window and yell Pepe to my daughter and she yells Pepe back. I have the best kid folks. The best. Well I hope they can afford good lawyers considering they're breaking about 5 different federal laws.Supposedly, the lawyer for the accuser is holding press conference at 6 p.m. EST, according to her Twitter.Lol I wonder if they only get paid if she wins.  Hahaha that would make the Trump victory even better!I think I have a relative who works for CTR. He starts a facebook war daily with baiting articles and totes the Hilary lines every chance he gets. I'd say totes the party line but it's worse, it's the Hilary line.Full disclosure: If ANYBODY writes anything else about MG Rossi I am slamming the fucking deport button. It is pure trolling and conspiracies that are not linked in any possible way to Hillary, Trump, or anything surrounding the candidates. Let a dead Soldier rest in peace. Stop connecting dots that are not there. I want nothing but dank memes and a trump train that doesn't stop. Enough is enough. Fuck you CTR and fuck you 4chan trolls for spreading bullshit. We will find you and we will deport you.https://m.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5atith/trump_supporters_have_raised_over_88000_to_repair/?compact=trueCrooked and her thugs it seems are up to there usual tricks. A black church earlier today was burned down and our God Emperor name was planted on it. I need not remind you of the "bird dogging" Crooked Thugs at the DNC do by planting mentally crazed people or actors at rallies and paying them to harass people right, ill do it anyway.President Trump isn't here to divide a racial and social divided nation like Barry Hussein has done, he wants to heal, strengthen it, and let it soar to greater heights. Let's help him.51% downvoted is all the evidence we need to see how CTR is fighting for their lives.  Congratulations, idiots, you played yourselves.This should be on the sidebar immediately!  Great fricken job Pede!  Thanks for this huge, gigantic red pill!You could screen grab every headline, compile with music, maybe add a few vid clips and it would go viral, guaranteed.I was thinking that the whole time. Make a clip of this. Some dramatic music as the hero rises. I'm thinking some Zimmerman Man of Steel album. I'd settle for an image, even a reader's digest version, that can be dispensed like a massive redpill vaccination.I’d recommend the Coldplay song “fix you”. Portrays this series of articles well.

MAGA- Trump 2016-2024!Amazing Job, Fantastic. Almost felt as good as election night meltdowns. The Left hasn’t been arguing numbers and facts, they will lose on substance every time. That’s why they try to appeal to emotion. Racist. Bigot. Unhinged. Things that are not quantitative. Things that can be measured are things like: the stock market, consumer confidence, unemployment. We win on ALL OF THOSE. Keep pushing the facts Pede’s. We have the greatest POTUS in the world! Which is how Trump is called an "anti-Semite" even though his daughter and grandchildren are Jewish, his son-in-law and trusted advisor is Jewish, he employs and works with hundreds, if not thousands, of Jewish people, he is the only sitting President to visit the Wailing Wall (while wearing a yarmulke), Netanyahu loves him, he has done more than anyone to eliminate radical Islamic terror from the face of the Earth, which ultimately seeks to genocide the Jews, and he's the first President to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and move the American embassy there. "Bro, it's so obvious. It's his secret inner thoughts. Like dude, listen to that dog whistle. It's so LOUD." Way too many bullets for my argument magazine!  Nice ammo for lefty fam at Christmas dinner discussions.  Nice work!Whenever someone can boil down the ills of the human condition with such ease, I am impressed!  I consider myself pretty based, but even I admit that 3.5 days of camping or something could really give me some good perspective on life!I will watch and rewatch and share and reshare the shit out of that video. Hell, I will pay 20 bucks to buy it.I lost my 10 year old 60k a year job under Obama. Almost 2 years later - after Trump won and was inaugurated - I finally became employed again. This shit is real folks. It effects people in different ways. When the company I worked for started closing locations I didn't really think it had to do with Obama's policies... but now, it's obvious it did. That piece of shit. So many regulations it was suffocating capitalism. A business can't breathe when being smothered with that much red tape. This...more than anything...pissed the hell out of me as a business owner. Hearing Bernie Sanders tell a woman who employs 50 hair stylists that if she can't pay for Obamacare regulations requiring healthcare then she doesn't deserve to be in business is another one. Most business owners I have met have gone broke many times to keep their businesses afloat. Haven't paid themselves for long periods of time, mortgaged their homes, and sacrificed time with family and friends to build their businesses. You want to talk about stress. Try telling your spouse you are leaving your great paying job of 40 hours a week because you want to start your own business and you are taking 50k to get started and you won't be drawing a salary for the first year...or two....while working nights and weekends and the kids will understand. That is their choice, but to spout on about how employees deserve a share is just bullshit. An employee signs on for a salary, gets paid, and goes home. Trust me, I've been on both sides...employees don't have a fraction of the stress that an owner holds.Anyone who thinks owning a successful business is so easy is invited to try it. See how long you last. Exactly. I own my own business. I didn’t take a draw for 3 years despite working 24/7. I created my own job and now I am in the position to create more jobs for people. I remember watching that Berne Cruz debate also with the salon owner. That infuriated me. Making a comment here because I will need to come back to this thread again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again.A+++ post.... my god, the hubris of the critics..... the arrogance, the posturing, the 'resisters' and naysayers..... they are looking like such pathetic clowns right now.

I consider myself pretty based, but even I admit that 3.5 days of camping or something could really give me some good perspective on life!I will watch and rewatch and share and reshare the shit out of that video.

Almost 2 years later - after Trump won and was inaugurated - I finally became employed again. This shit is real folks. It effects people in different ways. When the company I worked for started closing locations I didn't really think it had to do with Obama's policies... but now, it's obvious it did. That piece of shit. So many regulations it was suffocating capitalism. A business can't breathe when being smothered with that much red tape. This...more than anything...pissed the hell out of me as a business owner. Hearing Bernie Sanders tell a woman who employs 50 hair stylists that if she can't pay for Obamacare regulations requiring healthcare then she doesn't deserve to be in business is another one. Most business owners I have met have gone broke many times to keep their businesses afloat. Haven't paid themselves for long periods of time, mortgaged their homes, and sacrificed time with family and friends to build their businesses. You want to talk about stress. Try telling your spouse you are leaving your great paying job of 40 hours a week because you want to start your own business and you are taking 50k to get started and you won't be drawing a salary for the first year...or two....while working nights and weekends and the kids will understand. That is their choice, but to spout on about how employees deserve a share is just bullshit. An employee signs on for a salary, gets paid, and goes home. Trust me, I've been on both sides...employees don't have a fraction of the stress that an owner holds.Anyone who thinks owning a successful business is so easy is invited to try it. See how long you last. Exactly. I own my own business. I didn’t take a draw for 3 years despite working 24/7. I created my own job and now I am in the position to create more jobs for people.

What a great way to just expose the narratives that are created by the MSM and reveals how they use headlines to deceive. This just shows exactly what's going on, without any need to get into the minutiae. This is seriously such a fucking brilliant idea for any of the topics / narratives they pushTruth. Which is exactly why they wanted to control the entire thing with Net Neutrality. Praise be to Ajit Pai! Praise be to KEK!We can't ignore the decades-long economic cycles that were clearly evident during the 120 years before Trump gained office. The patterns were much clearer before 2008, but are now are more complicated since financial technology and related corruption are thoroughly Gaming the global financial systems. It's been generally down since 2008. An upswing is long overdue, and has been building. Nice to be experiencing it, regardless of who's in office. Truth.

I urge u to do same"!!! What a compete dope!So if Obama is stealing credit, if (and that's a big if) the economy does slip up, does that mean it's his fault too? With the stock market up over $5 trillion since Trump was elected, and the Dow hitting over 24 new record high, I guarantee you it doesn't matter what stocks he held, hahahaThat’s the problem right there; stupid leftists believe the shit that they repeat.

I love how they went from denial "no 3% can never happen ever again in a developed economy" to acceptance but like the liars they are "oh look 3% growth, a lot of it is actually Malik's brother legacy"Huge kudos to you for this amazing list - saved and bookmarked.  One small niggle.  In my extensive experience dealing with raging “liberals” they will dismiss the entire list once they see Breitbart or other heavy “right-wing” websites.Huge kudos to you for this amazing list - saved and bookmarked.

He was just owned to the core. Had no serious work ethic, drive, know-how, or vision for a prosperous America. Just a big smile and a good speaker, up until his last few years.

Just a big smile and a good speaker, up until his last few years. Oh man, I forgot about that "you didn't build that business, someone else did" line. Tremendously insulting, which became the standard for the 0bama presidency.I never forgot that remark. That's why if there was one thing I could say to Obama now it would be, "See this economy? You didn't build that. Donald Trump did."I never forgot that remark. That's why if there was one thing I could say to Obama now it would be, "See this economy? You didn't build that. Donald Trump did."When you look at all the 'news' publications and financial 'powerhouses' who said the economy would tank under Trump.. it looks EXACTLY like how they all said Hillary would win.These are people that are supposed to be the best in their fields. World Bank downgrades U.S growth after Trump elected. How did that work out? World Bank has something like 60 trillion market cap if you are considering every country they operate in.Even bigger picture here. You do not need to be a genius to be successful. You can clearly tell by just how wrong all these people who wrote those articles were.They were trying to create self fulfilling prophecies and move markets with their headlines. They aren't stupid, they know which policies will help and which ones will not. They were trying to scare idiots (liberals) into selling off their portfolios or reduce their 401k contributions.Just you wait to see the exposure of the trillionnaire crime families in the shadows behind this 100 year old conspiracy.  We got a taste with the collapse of the House of Saud.The world lived under a tyrannical parasitic evil for 100 years and now finally it is coming to light.World Bank has something like 60 trillion market cap if you are considering every country they operate in.The funny thing is liberals are still taking these people at their word.

Chinese boom level GDP growth. It's why the left is so scared and desperate: once America gets a taste of robust economy, there is literally no hope for the globalist neolibs in 2018 and beyond.It's almost endgame isn't it.  Once people see it happening it changes everything because they look back over 20 years plus of neo-liberalism globalism and see it was a lie aimed at redistributing wealth globally under faux-economic guises such as "comparative advantage".  What is going to happen next year after the tax cuts?  We will see large corporate investments into infrastructure.  Even more job growth.The doom and gloom about corporate tax cuts causing deficits will be proven false as corporations report record level earnings and actually pay US taxes; instead of sheltering and hiding the money overseas.The millennials will get jobs and start moving out of their parents basements.  They will start buying cars and the auto industry will begin reporting on improved sales numbers instead of record inventory levels.All of this is Basic Economics and Business.  CEO’s are looking at the facts and basing their decisions on future projections.  The economy will flourish.  It is all good news for taxpayers.  I think we will see another Trump tax plan in 2 years which targets families and individuals.  The original Trump tax plan which got largely scrapped and reworked by congress.Riding on a thriving economy President Trumps second term will focus on the crumbling US infrastructure, Global affairs, rescuing Europe, and rebuilding the Middle East (might even start hearing “peace in the Middle East” again).It's almost endgame isn't it.

The Left wants global communism with themselves in charge. The big impediment is the US which is why the goal of the Left is to destroy US capitalism. They knew what they were doing. It wasn’t a shock. They used the Fed to transfer Trilions to the politically connected from the lower and middle class. The goal is to make people so poor and desperate they welcome communism. They nearly succeeded.If Trump can maintain 4%+ growth they are in deep trouble. Growth makes prices drop so now people can afford the things they need. Work becomes worth more than welfare. Once a person tastes the dignity of a good paycheck from a hard days work they will never go back. This is why they were trying to hard to destroy Trump.Well, we'll see about the next few months and what sort of indictments they bring. These bastards have plenty of skeletons in their closet and the greatest POTUS in our lifetime has access to it all.Well, we'll see about the next few months and what sort of indictments they bring.

He scared investors and entrepreneurs away, just to make them come back in force this year. Genius!My sources indicate the Trump family is invested heavily in Stock Market. Clearly this is a conflict of interest here, He's getting rich off his own policies. So how can he take credit for Trump’s economy when there was ZERO growth for so long?? He can’t; the economy was sucking BECAUSE OF 0bama!Someone needs to compile this in video format, maybe with some news broadcasts spliced in between. Make it 2 minutes and we have a great redpill to serve!! At the bottom of the screen, with each new headline, include in fine print: "Source: <and then the link to the article of the headline>". Leftists won't trust their own observations and common sense, but if you include the word "source" on anything (even though the headline is its own source), they will have a Pavlovian response to that word and stop reeeeeeeesisting the red-pill. DUDE!!  I literally cried reading through that when Trump was elected and things started to turn around, actual tears. Nice work.I started laughing near the end as everything in the pre-election articles was proved hilariously wrong. President Trump is exposing and separating the people who genuinely wanted jobs to come back to the country from those who just said they did. I started laughing near the end as everything in the pre-election articles was proved hilariously wrong. Oh CBO, how can you be so rediculusly wrong yet still so respected by the press? One of those Mysteries of the Universe I guess.Change Obama to Trump in the first 20 or so headlines ... I'm sure the fake media would say positive things about the economy and the presidenthttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-alibaba/alibabas-ma-meets-trump-promises-to-bring-one-million-jobs-to-u-s-idUSKBN14T1ZAI had forgotten how negative Obama was. Those jobs aren't coming back, oppression this, unfair that, you didn't build that. He was so negative and divisive just a dark rain cloud over everything. Thats what makes Trump so much of a breath of fresh air. He's uplifting and positive. Thank you sweet baby Jesus Hillary is not our President. Wow...just WOW! Good times are here again and President Trump is just getting started. With the new tax cuts, our economy is going to set record levels. I am looking forward to seeing the rebuilding of our infrastructure and inner cities and the prosperity our country will enjoy as a result. America is back and our great President has just begun getting the Trump Train rolling. God bless President Trump and God bless America!Outstanding work pede!  Beautifully laid out and great for red-pilling as observed symptoms require. I figured it out, guys. Obama deserves all the credit for everything good that has happened during the Trump administration, and gets a pass on every failed policy he made because "look what Bush gave me."On the other hand, Trump deserves none of the current credit, and obviously cannot point a finger of blame at Obama because Obama never did anything bad. Obama is the kid in the classroom that tries to cheat off of you and take the credit, don't think so Barry.  You had your chance for 8 years you regulated the hell out of every aspect of the US economy to try to weaken America.  Thank God for Donald Trump and his magic wand, and for you snowflakes out there go get a job and stop bitching! Oh come on, that's not fair. "Community organizer" is a super important job. Think of all the times you've relied on your local "community organizer" in a pinch. And how he swooped in and saved the day. Think of all your friends. Have you ever tried calling up your local "community organizer" and the phone was busy? It's like how do you even function? I know I wouldn't be where I am today without my local "community organizer". Cops, clerks, construction workers, garbage collectors? Forget those useless dummies, those people are a dime a dozen. It's the community organizer who works so bravely to... uh... organize us... into... order... so we're not all... like... disorganized... and uh... then... does stuff... somewhere... I guess. "You didn't build that, somebody else did" is a riff on a message from God. In the Bible, when the People of God arrive at the Promised Land, they are told: "You are blessed. You did not make this land. I did. You did not build these homes. I gave them to you."Wow. I didn't catch that reference. Obama was actually trying to compare himself to the God of Israel. What hubris! And we all know what happened to the people with the too much hubris in the hero's journey..... The quote might sound similar, but I don't think that's accurate at all. Obama was more likely trying to riff on the famous Elizabeth Warren (a.k.a. Pocahontas) speech about "good for you - keep a big hunk of it" that made her go viral and put her on the map. If you remember, before that speech, she was basically a nobody. After it, she was memed all over Reddit, Jon Stewart put her on his show, and liberals everywhere instantly decided they loved her unconditionally. And it was only a few weeks after that happened that Obama pulled out his "you didn't build that" speech, which was an attempt at generating the same enthusiasm. But it backfired. The message is the same. Who should we be thankful to - Our God, Family, and Country, or just to our Government? President Obama has his answer. I have mine.Wow. I didn't catch that reference. Obama was actually trying to compare himself to the God of Israel. What hubris! And we all know what happened to the people with the too much hubris in the hero's journey..... People who claim Trumpnis just riding on the coattails of Obama’s economy don’t realize that the economy runs just as much on  confidence of the future as on actual business. Trump greatly increased the confidence. I remember listening to an NPR Podcast last summer where they called Trump's 3% goal unrealistic without mass migration. Well when you are using the American tax payers to line your own pocket, you are going to be bad for business. I own my own business and busted my ass to get it where it is. I didn’t collect a salary for 3 years despite working 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. Now I’m in the position to actually create additional jobs for people. You’re fucking welcome obama. It's the ultimate quote that perfectly encapsulates the Left's despicable mentality - and came out of mouth of their chief sleaze boyThese headlines should be broken apart by news Orgs and thrown in their fat Fucked Faces... those assclowns deserve to eat their own shitHow the hell could a President be so fine with a stagnant economy and faltering of the middle class?  It’s almost like Obama hated America..he held back the economy so much that he set the table for Trump to unleash all of the pent up economic forces.That guy is so insane. Poor kids have to live with him. State authorities need to rescue them before he turns their brains into shit too. Hopefully they know he's a douche and will oppose him politically once they are adults. Where is the headline that says: "Yes, the economy is failing, but Obama's policies just need another six months to a year to kick in. Expert economists predict HUGE GDP and stock market numbers right as Obama leaves." They think the only way to make money is to cheat and steal. Wrong!  Regular people will take this opportunity of a good economy to build something... Invest in a business.... Invest in themselvesThey don't even need to do that. They can loan their own campaign money, give it back, and earn interest on millions whenever they want. There is a lot more than that which they can do as well. It's quite awful.They don't even need to do that. They can loan their own campaign money, give it back, and earn interest on millions whenever they want. There is a lot more than that which they can do as well. It's quite awful."new normal" = just part and parcel of your new liberal rulers. They seem to like changing the status quo. “I’m not terribly excited about McCain being president, but I’m sure that Obama, if elected, will have a negative impact on business and the economy,”[The fact of the matter is, Democrats have their fingerprints all over the causes of the current bad economy, which was created by the meltdown in the housing finance market.  We can consider the disaster created by the Democrat’s Community Reinvestment Act.  We can examine the disastrous role of the Democrats’ baby, the GSEs (Fannie and Freddie).  We can recognize that not only were all the top leaders of the GSEs career Democrats, but that the top financial recipients of Fannie’s and Freddies’ campaign contributions went to Democrats such as Chris Dodd and Barack Obama (and the same is true of corrupt and now bankrupted banks such as Lehman Bros).  We can consider the fact that Democrats blocked several Republican attempts to reign in the disastrous and frankly corrupt operations of the GSEs, which held nearly $6 trillion in mortgages.  And we can consider the fact that Democrats were in charge of regulating Fannie and Freddie during the last two years while their stock plunged 90% – and failed to act until it was too late.
But let us recognize as the economy continues to go down the toilet that the profound lack of confidence in the economy is actually due to a profound lack of confidence by our business leaders and our investors in the President and in his policies.]From one of the OP's links. Written less than one month into Obama's presidency. I think about this shit when I see pedes write that they are a former Obama voter, or that they voted for Bernie in the primaries. Bernie is Like Obama on steroids minus the corrupt BS...BUT.... We know his wife is a crook, and usually the apple don't fall far from the tree. So WTF?To the Pede who created this: thank you for your hard work. This was so badass. I tip my red MAGA hat to you sir.This is great stuff, people here should spread wide and far.  Now a days all most people read are headlines.  Making this sort of headline only thread is very powerful.This would make a great video. Across the bottom plot US GDP over time. Scroll through the line graph, and show the headline in the main body of the video correlating with dates as they pass.They love getting their hands on the reigns, mucking it up with crony regulations, destroying the free market, and saying, "Look at how bad capitalism is. We. Need something different. Now give us your donation, and vote for bigger government next time, because you can't survive without our help!"I believe that was the Net Neutrality plan as well. All those doomsday scenarios of an internet controlled by the free market? That was projection of what they had planned if Net Neutrality took off. It's a brilliant strategy too, because once they've told people those are "free market failures", then their own intentional sabotaging of the internet could have been used to demand more power. Just keep wrecking it and blaming it on your opponent until you accumulate everything for yourself. http://thefederalistpapers.integratedmarket.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/17690083_1475022012518625_692231977_n-1.jpgThat is why we don't believe the MSM or iberal pundits.

Good job with the update, the CNN list is extensive! What's insane is how big these stump sheets could be.Actually that's the point, it IS a joke.  Now it's just becoming desperate and sad. Throw in the towel CNN. Or as Podesta calls it the "Pizza related Map "Actually that's the point, it IS a joke.  Now it's just becoming desperate and sad. Throw in the towel CNN.

Or as Podesta calls it the "Pizza related Map "This is fucking amazing. How can I archive al of these links in case this thread gets Vince fostered Fellow caterpillars, I think this might be a bad direction! Surely we are better than this! We should take the high road and work towards unity with our democrat brothers and John McCain!Every day, whether it is a bad one or a good one, I can count on the weaponized autism and high energy memetics of The_Donald to pick my spirits up and remind me why I am in this fight.To liberate this country from the near stranglehold the globalists put it in so my children can have a better, more meaningful future.This needs to be permanently stuck to the sidebar or locked down in a wiki page in the subreddit. Great job everyone! http://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/judicial-watch-court-hearing-monday-march-13-lawsuit-demanding-state-ask-doj-pursue-clinton-emails/Why does it say, " the Trump State Department told Judicial Watch this week that it would continue to object to asking the Attorney General to take steps to recover Clinton’s emails." WTF?!Why does it say, " the Trump State Department told Judicial Watch this week that it would continue to object to asking the Attorney General to take steps to recover Clinton’s emails." WTF?!Incredible! Thank you for such a YUGE compilation of liberal lies! This needs to be promoted or put on its own website!You're welcome. We'll be making more of an effort on the archival/list front going forward. Otherwise info gets lost too easily.Thank you to all those who contributed to this list.

We wanted to get this out this weekend even though it's not complete. Hang tight while we work on it more in the coming weeks and beyond.Tremendous list. I needed this ammunition to red pill some of my never-Trump friends. Thank you for your hard work. Thank you so much for compiling this. I am not giving you gold as it supports this site but this is a lot of ammo. I don't support Reddit so I won't give you gold, but this is the kind of post that deserves it. There's enough data in here to sink any liberal's argument like a brick.So happy to be a part of something that made a difference in our community. I hope you love the sheet, 'pedes! Make good use of it. We are 29.3% of our goal to coat the 655,770 great people of Memphis, Tennessee. Lets make sure everyone gets a coat in the United States! For every Centipede a coat for every coat a Centipede!Can I just say how god damn impressed I am with The_Donald? A fucking beacon in a sea of horse shit. Much love from Australia.I love it when the TDS sufferers start railing about the Koch brothers who did not even support GEOTUS. These people just blindly hate whatever they are told to with no critical thought applied.No, the Deep State runs the secret government. Make a list of those folks who obstruct or bash Trump publicly, and you'll get a rough idea of its members.Hey, I just wanna say I’m glad to see you here. It’s nice to see other sides of the political spectrum coming and actually having productive conversation. From a pede to a liberal, thank youI'm not really from the other side. Progressives in America who perhaps used to be liberal have moved further and further towards Marxist ideals while retaining the word 'liberal' which kind of dirties it. "Liberalism, political doctrine that takes protecting and enhancing the freedom of the individual to be the central problem of politics. Liberals typically believe that government is necessary to protect individuals from being harmed by others, but they also recognize that government itself can pose a threat to liberty."I think most of us agree with this statement, no? The American left is no longer liberal and has moved pretty far towards post modernist ideals. This is what I tell liberals that haven't been weaned from the milk yet. Sometimes you've gotta just talk in words they can understand. I've learned that it's far easier a pill to swallow for a libcuck to hear that I am a Classical Liberal that supports the 2nd Amendment to the death rather then the same statement while saying I'm a hardline conservative. The dems and Hollywood have really truly programmed your average liberal in to reacting to specific buzz words. The only thing that exists in the mind of A liberal are republicans and democrats. They haven't even considered the possibility of a libertarian or classical liberal or even a marxist because morning Joe  and cnn keeps them on a real strict and tight attention span. Just like Harriet tubman once stated "I could have freed more slaves if only they knew they were slaves". This is a huge, maybe crucial distinction. The democratic party has a huge image problem. You hear someones a liberal and thanks to an extremely vocal minority theyre associated with safe spaces, gender neutral pronouns, self righteousness masquerading as victimhood, politically ignorant condescension, i mean it goes on and on. This weird cultural movement that by all rights should be confined to college campuses is contaminating national politics. The vast majority of left leaning voters are not "snowflakes". Holy shit though that girl with the mic was shrill. I was on her side but she still got on my nerves. It's confusing, I considered myself a liberal my entire life.  One day I woke up and being a liberal was the most backwards crazy ass thing in existence.  We are all in the same boat. I always considered myself a moderate but now I'm suddenly a right wing extremist because I support the founding principles of our Republic, our Constitution, and the rule of law.I am a hairs breadth away from outright conservatism but the rule of law part is always going to be the sticking point. I mean for an ethos that promotes the minimum of government interference in day to day life, they fucking love putting people in prison. Im talking about the drug offenders mainly here. My idea of small government isnt an institution that can brand you as a felon, virtually ruining your life, simply for POSSESSING a substance thats not alcohol. Or marijuana in some states. Punitive measures dont work on drug addicts. Disenfranchising them only pushes them into further desperation. The drug war is over, its lost, i mean holy shit its been what 30 odd years since it was declared and here we are with a heroin epidemic. Kids are dying, but fuck it assett forfeiture (how is this constitutional?) is fattening DEA and local PD coffers and for-profit prisons are an emerging market!! If this drug war wasnt so darn profitable maybe wed think about surrenderingIsnt it funny to think about a hypothetical small government supporting Trump voter whose car is impounded and subsequently seized by the police because her son was arrested in it transporting a few ounces of weed? Even funnier, picture her at a bus stop while she watches her car, repainted and sporting a hilarious "provided by your local drug dealer" slogan cruising by. FUCK THAT. Until republicans repudiate situations like that i cant cross over.The only real difference was I used to be violently atheist to a point of considering anyone that wasn't a complete fucking moron who wasn't worth pissing on.  I became older and realized people do what people need or want and live/let live.  Still an Atheist, just not a dumb douche about it.Yeah but these idiots still vote, and you know god damn well they aren't gonna vote for Conservatives or Republicans.  If Leftists win, it would end up being a complete fucking disaster, quite possibly for generations to come.   You could shut them down all day with however many facts you want and they'd still go against it just for spite.Right, because it's emotional and all based on false sense of moral superiority. If you don't agree with them you're horrible human being or worst you're a disgusting nazi.This video, ignoring the dubbed audio, plus his Hitler Youth Brownshirt photo (the similarities of which there is no way he didn't know) this kid is probably living out his Hitler Power Fantasy.Irs mind boggling they're being played like a fiddle and CNN is parading them around and throwing them multiple parades and were crazy to say this is being organized.Sorry to high jack your thread but after today's March for Gun control, I'm seriously concerned, so I have to get this off my chest...Fellow Patriots, you must not get complacent, this is the next generation, these are the people who are charged and ready to fight, if you sit back and do nothing they will win and you can say goodbye to America.President Trump can't drain the swamp on his own, he needs you to vote out the corrupt DemoRats and RINO's.If I'm ever privileged enough to move to the US, I want to move to the America I/We all know and love, the America that is a bastion of hope, opportunity, freedom and patriotism, an America with guns and free speech.Fellow Patriots, you must not get complacent, this is the next generation, these are the people who are charged and ready to fight, if you sit back and do nothing they will win and you can say goodbye to America.Don't be that concerned. Most of the people that march in these types of things are people on SSI or college students or NEETS. The majority of people hat contribute to society and have common sense stay home and vote when it counts.The levels of brainwashing are astounding. They won’t even listen for 3 seconds. They see the InfoWars logo and automatically start screaming pre-programmed misinformation and accusations. Of course they are bc it is one of the last media outlets they don't control, to respond to it is to legitimize it.  It is actually smart of them to dismiss it.  They aren't being stupid by doing this, it is a calculated move.  Don't underestimate them.These idiots have been conditioned to respond that way. The calculated move was on the part of those who did the conditioning.They act like this because they're winning and they know it. The entire system supports them so they don't have to make arguments or even sense.I don't think that's it because they were acting like that during the election while losing. I think they just generally act like this because they think they are winning irrespective of reality lol. Ah but remember that during the election they believed that they were winning!  Every fucking poll showed Trump losing by a landslide! They act like this because they've never had to be accountable for their own words or deeds. Their b.s. is tolerated and rewarded as "creativity" by their teachers and peers, and when they cross the line their parents have had to pay the penalty. So they go through life congratulating themselves for "winning." i.e., being assholes. Eventually they'll be met with reality and become responsible, or become resentful and blame the world for their failures.And ironically the latter are often the ones who end up committing acts of violence; well-adjusted individuals don’t go that route.They’re also extremely young. I don’t think any of these people are over 25 and not only are their brains not fully capable yet, they don’t have the experience and mental training to formulate solid ideas. I’m almost 40 and I can easily crush arguments if younger people bc I’ve had a lot more mental training. Some of my peers who are just higher thinkers can dance around and take apart my ideas.  We need to stop acting like all brains are equal, immediately. They are not equal. We know through science that brains take time to develop. We also know that experience and mental exercise builds cognitive function.  To any younger person who wants to refute that, I would be more than happy to buy us drinks at a bar and start walking through ideas. In working with millenials I’m very confident they’ll turn to rage and anger and insults. They’re the generation of feelings. Generation Know it All. Gen Z people I speak with are completely different. They’re 100% committed to finding out more and admitting they aren’t mystical prophets with all the answers.  Nah, they’re acting like shitlib cucks because it gets them attention.  They’re essentially throwing tantrums because they aren’t getting theyre way.  what the fuck are they winning? the royal ass award? is this the first time you have ever seen a liberal? perpetually snarky and fake laughing thats a liberal in a nutshell for the last 20 yearswere back to obama how? when has a country not been divided over politics? have you ever checked into the real fucking world?legit low energy fucking faggot that likes bitching about losing you literally outed yourself as a shill soyboyThey are literally sucessfully taking away peoples freedom of speech, they are controling the media for the most part.  Social media, they completely control.  Don't be naive about what is happening.  Our Congress turned on us yesterday for the whole world to see.  You do realize Trump can change the budget around in the bill if it’s a “national security emergency issue” right?Prepare for the saltiest of tears next Friday. No one expected him to sign it. They though he was going to veto. Also it’s not even a budget so much as a suggestion of allocations. Basically, Trump can do whatever the fuck he wants with the money. He signed it for the military funding. That’s going to be plenty for the tribunals for the swamp monsters, as well as for the Army Corp of Engineers to start on the Wall.Gonna wait for it and come right back to this spot. When presidents use their emergency powers, it’s fuckin awesome. Makes me so fuckun mad because everyone is persuaded by their arguments even though I know how wrong they are. It's like the emperor with no clothes. It doesn't matter what reality actually is when you hold all the power it's whatever you want it to be. Anyone who steps out of line well....Let's be real here the only reason Hillary isn't in the White House despite the rigging was because we came out in numbers never dreamed of and threw their skews off.Hillary was supposed to win that. It's why the media was so dumbfounded when they had everything ready for the Hillary win and the states came back saying Trump won. She lost a rigged election that was rigged for her.I don't think they're going to make the same mistakes they did last time this time around. And thinking you can trust a Democrat and these globalists is the Zenith of foolishness.They are not winning. I just bought 3000 rounds of 556 and 30 bump stocks for principal. They will never take from me.I would argue it's actually a typical liberal. They've just gotten dumber over the years, but they're all knuckle-dragging sheep. I cannot wait until they try to fight us.The answer is, to ensure that the first remains in place and allow the rest to remain in place under penalty of "The People say so, go ahead, try it."And don't forget the laughter. Liberals love to laugh. It's easy filler for when they have nothing to say. If they were intelligent then they would be republican or at least right leaning.  Stupid people have a place to go, the left.I love it when the TDS sufferers start railing about the Koch brothers who did not even support GEOTUS. These people just blindly hate whatever they are told to with no critical thought applied.No, the Deep State runs the secret government.

I've learned that it's far easier a pill to swallow for a libcuck to hear that I am a Classical Liberal that supports the 2nd Amendment to the death rather then the same statement while saying I'm a hardline conservative. The dems and Hollywood have really truly programmed your average liberal in to reacting to specific buzz words. The only thing that exists in the mind of A liberal are republicans and democrats. They haven't even considered the possibility of a libertarian or classical liberal or even a marxist because morning Joe  and cnn keeps them on a real strict and tight attention span. Just like Harriet tubman once stated "I could have freed more slaves if only they knew they were slaves". Usually, when they call themselves liberal, they actually aren’t liberal.  They’re just Democrats.  You know, like Antifa calling themselves anti-fascists.  I don’t know if they skipped out on civics class or their civics teacher taught them gender studies instead.Fuckin democrats.

I really don't want to have to go to war w8th these fucks it would be too easy.... It's confusing, I considered myself a liberal my entire life.  One day I woke up and being a liberal was the most backwards crazy ass thing in existence.  We are all in the same boat. I always considered myself a moderate but now I'm suddenly a right wing extremist because I support the founding principles of our Republic, our Constitution, and the rule of law.I am a hairs breadth away from outright conservatism but the rule of law part is always going to be the sticking point. I mean for an ethos that promotes the minimum of government interference in day to day life, they fucking love putting people in prison. Im talking about the drug offenders mainly here. My idea of small government isnt an institution that can brand you as a felon, virtually ruining your life, simply for POSSESSING a substance thats not alcohol. Or marijuana in some states. Punitive measures dont work on drug addicts. Disenfranchising them only pushes them into further desperation. The drug war is over, its lost, i mean holy shit its been what 30 odd years since it was declared and here we are with a heroin epidemic. Kids are dying, but fuck it assett forfeiture (how is this constitutional?) is fattening DEA and local PD coffers and for-profit prisons are an emerging market!! If this drug war wasnt so darn profitable maybe wed think about surrenderingIsnt it funny to think about a hypothetical small government supporting Trump voter whose car is impounded and subsequently seized by the police because her son was arrested in it transporting a few ounces of weed? Even funnier, picture her at a bus stop while she watches her car, repainted and sporting a hilarious "provided by your local drug dealer" slogan cruising by. FUCK THAT. Until republicans repudiate situations like that i cant cross over.The only real difference was I used to be violently atheist to a point of considering anyone that wasn't a complete fucking moron who wasn't worth pissing on.  I became older and realized people do what people need or want and live/let live.  Still an Atheist, just not a dumb douche about it.We are all in the same boat.

If you don't agree with them you're horrible human being or worst you're a disgusting nazi.This video, ignoring the dubbed audio, plus his Hitler Youth Brownshirt photo (the similarities of which there is no way he didn't know) this kid is probably living out his Hitler Power Fantasy.Irs mind boggling they're being played like a fiddle and CNN is parading them around and throwing them multiple parades and were crazy to say this is being organized.This video, ignoring the dubbed audio, plus his Hitler Youth Brownshirt photo (the similarities of which there is no way he didn't know) this kid is probably living out his Hitler Power Fantasy.Irs mind boggling they're being played like a fiddle and CNN is parading them around and throwing them multiple parades and were crazy to say this is being organized.Sorry to high jack your thread but after today's March for Gun control, I'm seriously concerned, so I have to get this off my chest...Fellow Patriots, you must not get complacent, this is the next generation, these are the people who are charged and ready to fight, if you sit back and do nothing they will win and you can say goodbye to America.President Trump can't drain the swamp on his own, he needs you to vote out the corrupt DemoRats and RINO's.If I'm ever privileged enough to move to the US, I want to move to the America I/We all know and love, the America that is a bastion of hope, opportunity, freedom and patriotism, an America with guns and free speech.Fellow Patriots, you must not get complacent, this is the next generation, these are the people who are charged and ready to fight, if you sit back and do nothing they will win and you can say goodbye to America.Don't be that concerned. Most of the people that march in these types of things are people on SSI or college students or NEETS. The majority of people hat contribute to society and have common sense stay home and vote when it counts.The levels of brainwashing are astounding. They won’t even listen for 3 seconds. They see the InfoWars logo and automatically start screaming pre-programmed misinformation and accusations. Of course they are bc it is one of the last media outlets they don't control, to respond to it is to legitimize it.  It is actually smart of them to dismiss it.  They aren't being stupid by doing this, it is a calculated move.  Don't underestimate them.These idiots have been conditioned to respond that way. The calculated move was on the part of those who did the conditioning.Of course they are bc it is one of the last media outlets they don't control, to respond to it is to legitimize it.

The entire system supports them so they don't have to make arguments or even sense.I don't think that's it because they were acting like that during the election while losing. I think they just generally act like this because they think they are winning irrespective of reality lol. Ah but remember that during the election they believed that they were winning!  Every fucking poll showed Trump losing by a landslide! They act like this because they've never had to be accountable for their own words or deeds. Their b.s. is tolerated and rewarded as "creativity" by their teachers and peers, and when they cross the line their parents have had to pay the penalty. So they go through life congratulating themselves for "winning." i.e., being assholes. Eventually they'll be met with reality and become responsible, or become resentful and blame the world for their failures.And ironically the latter are often the ones who end up committing acts of violence; well-adjusted individuals don’t go that route.They’re also extremely young. I don’t think any of these people are over 25 and not only are their brains not fully capable yet, they don’t have the experience and mental training to formulate solid ideas. I’m almost 40 and I can easily crush arguments if younger people bc I’ve had a lot more mental training. Some of my peers who are just higher thinkers can dance around and take apart my ideas.  We need to stop acting like all brains are equal, immediately. They are not equal. We know through science that brains take time to develop. We also know that experience and mental exercise builds cognitive function.  To any younger person who wants to refute that, I would be more than happy to buy us drinks at a bar and start walking through ideas. In working with millenials I’m very confident they’ll turn to rage and anger and insults. They’re the generation of feelings. Generation Know it All. Gen Z people I speak with are completely different. They’re 100% committed to finding out more and admitting they aren’t mystical prophets with all the answers.  Nah, they’re acting like shitlib cucks because it gets them attention.  They’re essentially throwing tantrums because they aren’t getting theyre way.  what the fuck are they winning? the royal ass award? is this the first time you have ever seen a liberal? perpetually snarky and fake laughing thats a liberal in a nutshell for the last 20 yearswere back to obama how? when has a country not been divided over politics? have you ever checked into the real fucking world?legit low energy fucking faggot that likes bitching about losing you literally outed yourself as a shill soyboyThey are literally sucessfully taking away peoples freedom of speech, they are controling the media for the most part.  Social media, they completely control.  Don't be naive about what is happening.  Our Congress turned on us yesterday for the whole world to see.  You do realize Trump can change the budget around in the bill if it’s a “national security emergency issue” right?Prepare for the saltiest of tears next Friday. No one expected him to sign it. They though he was going to veto. Also it’s not even a budget so much as a suggestion of allocations. Basically, Trump can do whatever the fuck he wants with the money. He signed it for the military funding. That’s going to be plenty for the tribunals for the swamp monsters, as well as for the Army Corp of Engineers to start on the Wall.Gonna wait for it and come right back to this spot. When presidents use their emergency powers, it’s fuckin awesome. Makes me so fuckun mad because everyone is persuaded by their arguments even though I know how wrong they are. It's like the emperor with no clothes. It doesn't matter what reality actually is when you hold all the power it's whatever you want it to be. Anyone who steps out of line well....Let's be real here the only reason Hillary isn't in the White House despite the rigging was because we came out in numbers never dreamed of and threw their skews off.Hillary was supposed to win that. It's why the media was so dumbfounded when they had everything ready for the Hillary win and the states came back saying Trump won. She lost a rigged election that was rigged for her.I don't think they're going to make the same mistakes they did last time this time around. And thinking you can trust a Democrat and these globalists is the Zenith of foolishness.They are not winning. I just bought 3000 rounds of 556 and 30 bump stocks for principal. They will never take from me.I don't think that's it because they were acting like that during the election while losing.

Anyone who steps out of line well....I would argue it's actually a typical liberal. They've just gotten dumber over the years, but they're all knuckle-dragging sheep. I cannot wait until they try to fight us.All of them are just so angry.  Its obvious that other problems in their lives are compounding into loony politics.  Reddit is a place where people talk about changing the world when oftentimes, they haven't bothered to see if they should change themselves first. You don’t have to have problems to be angry when you’re 16. It can just be a mask you try on like “vegetarian” or “genderfluid otterkin”I identify as an F-18 super hornet, I'm sexually aroused by dropping massive loads on radical islamic terrorists. All is ask is for people to respect my identity and be sex-positive about my sexual desire to drop massive bombs. If you do not respect this you are an intolerant bigot and litterally worse than Hitler.Everyone recognizes there is something seriously wrong.  But just like looking for a job, it takes plowing thru 199 failed attempts before finding the bullseye.  If I hadn’t experienced the coordinated lies for myself, I probably would’ve fallen for the same bs as everyone else.  Daddy issues. Don't laugh, I'm being serious. Every one, you dig down, seriously fucked up family, especially the dad relationship.It's funny you say that, because when I argue with some of them over various topics, before I call them an idiot, moron, or whatever, they ask me why I'm such an angry person.  It's the stupidest thing, because I don't say anything ridiculous until they call me a Nazi or whatever.  Usually I'm laughing at their arguments, which is evident by me quoting them, then posting "lol" or "lmfao" before rebutting what they say.  Granted, I haven't wasted a lot of time as of late with them, just funny how they think I'm an angry person when I'm laughing the whole time.After knowing many democrats, most of them are just angry and looking for someone to push around.  I think it gives them a feeling that their not such tools and also feeds their rampant egos.  They truly believe that they are the smartest of the smart. I would love to see a reality show that gives a challenge to two individuals,  a Democrat and a Republican and rate their success. Let's find out what really separates us as thinkers.  Hell yeah, that'd be a great YT channel, but you've got to somehow be perceived as unbiased as possible as Democrats would never show up otherwise.  The majority of Republicans/conservatives have no problem with controversy.  But yeah, IRL they seem to hate it when I'm laughing while arguing with them.  They just say the damndest shit.Well they would show up for thw challenge, the rewards, the fame. Coming up with worthy challenges would be your biggest headache. Challenge business skills, people skills, animal skills, compassion, etc. Hmm, literally Joe Rogan would win at all of that, yet even he has no clue where he stands on the spectrum.He's big in MMA, hosted fear factor, and now has a pretty good podcast that gets into politics every now and then.  But if you watch him interview those on each side, back to back, it's pretty hard to tell where he actually stands.  Which is kinda nice actually.It is calculated. They do that to be condescending, it is manipulative.  If they can paint you as being emotionally out of control than anything you said can be dismissed.Yeah, I got that sense, and noticed it really irritated them that I never got offended, but laughed whenever they called me racist, sexist, or what have you.The guy seemed a bit off kilter so I did some digging. Turns out he was literally a cuck who was worried about STDs...They'll be marching against something else next month...but not innocent babies killed by planned parenthood. They don't give a shit about that. Reddit is a place where people talk about changing the world when oftentimes, they haven't bothered to see if they should change themselves first.

They keep overlooking the fact that they still pay for their free babysitters via property taxes.Actually, property taxes within the same county as the school district pays for most of public school funding. Federal govt contributes about 10% of the cost.Maybe go back to the days where the once room school houses existed.  Not ban schools just more smaller schools.I'm a public school teacher. 90% of the problems I face on a daily basis are because the school is too big. Every class I teach is over 30 students. Kids get away with misbehavior consistently.  In the small town I live in they started this Liberal Arts experimental school that has 50 students grades 9-12 where they teach critical thinking skills, Latin, Archery, and variour other stuff on top of the required courses.  My son graduated from it last year and he loved it.  He had plenty of one on one help from his teachers and had a 4.0GPA at graduation.  I really think It is best to go back to this kind of schooling and the teachers at this school say they love it.  I imagine it would be much better for them as well.  This school has had no discipline problems in their 6 years of operation.And giant schools breed the isolation and invisibility of the 'fall through the cracks' kids. My kids' and grandkids' elementary schools are over 1500-2000 kids. I remember our elementary principal's frustration over required attendance at a conference where they were offering advice that just could not translate. She finally stood up and asked how many students the panel members had in their schools. They all came from schools with 250-300 students. "With respect ladies, my kindergarten is larger than that."Unfortunately true.  They keep overlooking the fact that they still pay for their free babysitters via property taxes.Actually, property taxes within the same county as the school district pays for most of public school funding.

In the small town I live in they started this Liberal Arts experimental school that has 50 students grades 9-12 where they teach critical thinking skills, Latin, Archery, and variour other stuff on top of the required courses.  My son graduated from it last year and he loved it.  He had plenty of one on one help from his teachers and had a 4.0GPA at graduation.  I really think It is best to go back to this kind of schooling and the teachers at this school say they love it.  I imagine it would be much better for them as well.  This school has had no discipline problems in their 6 years of operation.And giant schools breed the isolation and invisibility of the 'fall through the cracks' kids. My kids' and grandkids' elementary schools are over 1500-2000 kids. I remember our elementary principal's frustration over required attendance at a conference where they were offering advice that just could not translate. She finally stood up and asked how many students the panel members had in their schools. They all came from schools with 250-300 students. "With respect ladies, my kindergarten is larger than that."Unfortunately true.  They keep overlooking the fact that they still pay for their free babysitters via property taxes.Actually, property taxes within the same county as the school district pays for most of public school funding. Federal govt contributes about 10% of the cost.Unfortunately true.

Then once everyone is several hundred years old, no one will be liberal anymore after having to pay 200 years of taxes...Yeah I thought she was not very good. Very harsh, with her points kind of getting lost because she's not very articulate under pressure.Yup these reporters are way too inexperienced to even argue for our side properly. People like Ben Shapiro, Crowder, Molenuex would absolutely destroy these faggots.Lauren Southern also manages to keep calm and be articulate in these 'street reporting' situations. She's great at holding up a mirror to the leftist hypocrites. I could too. But if you're a male mobs will threaten you with violence. You have to have a stage like Crowder with an orderly line or it's screaming and violence. These people only use their base instincts. You know when you want to do something really bad but you be patient. You swallow your thoughts and wait for the opportune moment to comment? They've never done that in their lives. They never had a father figure to discipline them. Never had a boyfriend competent enough to challenge them. They're children swarming around. Grasping to anything that gives them comfort away from their own desperate pathetic boring selves. I wish a hostile alien race would show up so we could stop being so shitty to each other. All of this shitty otherness just ruins a society during times of peace.Lauren Southern also manages to keep calm and be articulate in these 'street reporting' situations.

I would not have have had the patience for that bullshit. You must mean someone other than I think, then. The valley girl voiced "you're disgusting" drone up front wasn't respectful.Plus her voice is fucking horrible, I mean Jesus talk a little lower. It sounds terrible on video, very screechy. Yeah I was a little disappointed with her lack of rhetoric. If this was Steven Crowder or Ben Shapiro they would all feel like idiots. She wasn’t calm and didn’t spout intelligent rebuttals fast enough. Not the best. The dude with the Grease Lightening hairdo is a total hardo beta-cuck and could have been easily put in his place with better discourse.  She’s no alex Jones or Steven crowder, but honestly, in a crowd like that, only a 5’ Nothing blonde female has any chance whatsoever of safety in that situation. If it were Alex or another popular male conservative, I’d have expected violence when the left is threatened with “ideas contrary to their own”. Owen Shroyer always comes prepared with the facts. He can hold his own debating against a crowd full of leftists, like in that video with Aids Skrillex and Carl The Cuck. You don't have to have numbers, when facts and the truth is in your side.Owen Shroyer always comes prepared with the facts.

Much better watching NuanceBro or Fleccastalks"I don't let my past dictate my future, so if we ban guns we don't have to end up like [every other country who grabbed guns]."The whole point of going to high school is that you soak up knowledge - of past successes and failures - and from there, go forth as someone who at least has a basic grasp of what it means to be a productive citizen, and to be a part of society at large.If you are going to be a part of society, you should probably have a strong understanding of our laws - starting, first and foremost, with the Constitution. And what these marchers - ESPECIALLY the high schoolers - are demonstrating is that they have absolutely no idea what the Constitution means, what the Supreme Court does, etc. They think that by marching up and down the streets, holding signs, retweeting and liking posts, that they can effectively rule the nation by fiat - nevermind elections, nevermind legislation. If they march for it and demand it, they want it effected into law.Could they make actual contributions to society in the future? Sure. Will they create wealth of their own, create their own companies? Possibly. But when you listen to the words and thoughts coming out of their mouths, it's not looking good. These are people who are increasingly relying on the federal government (and national news media) for all of their sustenance, shelter, education, etc. We are raising an entire generation of folks that truly believe that to start any business or to succeed in anything that isn't sports, you necessarily must go to school for X amount of years and obtain Y degree. But not just any school - it must be a federally accredited school, with federal loans and grants available. ONLY THEN can you obtain the necessary knowledge to do things like build a house, or assemble a computer, or who knows what else.Just reading that last sentence, you can see where the problem lies. There's absolutely no need to obtain a 4-year degree to build a house, or to start a landscaping company, or to repair kitchen appliances. There are plenty of jobs available that pay 50K, 75K, 100K or more yearly to do these things - but to these braindead zombies, such jobs don't even exist because they can't get a degree in them from Berkeley or Harvard. So once the teaching jobs and the accounting jobs and the programming jobs fill up, what is there to do? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Burger-flipping doesn't pay the bills, so why work at all? There's certainly no such thing as blue collar jobs anymore, right?  We've outsourced all our plumbing jobs to China!These kids are setting themselves up for failure. Some people just aren't meant for the college environment - they don't thrive, they don't soak the knowledge, they don't put in the hard work. A lot of that has to do with the fact they're hypocrites and can't spot inconsistencies in their ways; so they're unable to problem-solve effectively because they rely on assumptions and "should be trues" instead of facts and "I've verified that this is the case". When they inevitably fail out of college, they will be despondent and not have any idea what to do with themselves. Probably move back in with mommy and daddy, become a drain on society, and do nothing but go on Reddit and Twitter and Instagram and harp on about how the system is "broken" and "failed" them because NRA and Republicans and Citizens United and who knows what else.These people don't want freedom - they want a step-by-step list of tasks to complete. They don't want education - they want indoctrination. They don't want free enterprise - they want to be assigned to a career. They want Communism, my dude."I don't let my past dictate my future, so if we ban guns we don't have to end up like [every other country who grabbed guns].""It's so easy to just bash the 2nd Amendment and bash guns. It's hard to look at all the facts. It's hard to realize that guns aren't the issue here. It's easy to regurgitate talking points. It's easy to do what your peers say."...And faggots.

These cameras cost anywhere from $500 for an entry level camera to about $6,000-$8,000 for just the body of the camera. Lenses can be far more expensive.Now, why would a cameraman for a field reporter use such a relatively cheap camera? Well, just as she explained. Violent babies on the left like to damage their equipment. They were using a still camera in video mode because the types of cameras that large organizations like FOX or CNN use can VERY EASILY reach 6 figure sums. A smaller organization will never use cameras this expensive in such a dangerous area.I'm a photographer. So yea, she's correct that prices for photography/videography equipment have come down, but she's a brain dead fuckwit nonetheless.Not one of these protesters has a clue as to why they are even there let alone any knowledge of guns. It’s about the same rationale they use when they vote. I only watched for a few minutes. The old people shuffling by in the background looked confused, like they thought they were at a rally against school violence and found out it was something else anti 2nd amendment.I only watched for a few minutes.

You are witnessing the ego working beyond capacity to defend itself.The guy in the glasses is actually pretty intelligent. There might be hope for him. I always hate to see smart kids like that on the wrong team. Asks one guy if he wants to ban guns. Says sure, let's do it. Another guy walks by and says nobody here is talking about banning guns literally one second later, and then turns back to the guy who just said all guns should be banned. That guy seemed actually smart enough to talk to but at the end of the day there's no way we can convince him unless maybe his house had an intruder while he was asleep and then he would wake up The US is the most war hungry country on Earth.  Anyone who thinks the US government won't go full tyranny as soon as we are disarmed is not firing on all cylinders.  We've been at nonstop war for decades now.  Look at 9/11.  Something happened there, and it wasn't a bunch of Arab cave dwellers who did that.  Whoever did 9/11 desperately wants our guns.  I won't live under tyranny.  If they come for my guns they better bring body armor.We could exploit that by having a program where we talk to them one on one and go through each issue. It will be tough and they may be sucked right back into the media world. But its what we have to do to save this republic. Their brains are just so mushy. Empathy is merely the ability to see the suffering/experience of others and go "yes, that would suck if it were to happen to me.  therefore I realize that it must suck for you as well."It doesn't mean you have to care about what happens to them, just that you have the ability to "walk a mile in their shoes"I'm sure this content is great but it's like an hour of footage to watch to find the goods. Couldn't we get an editAnd possibly a different "reporter"? I couldn't get through it either. I feel we too are not sending our best. I tried so hard to watch it all, but something about her voice and inflections just makes me feel like she is baiting just as bad as anyone else there.It's a really rare thing to find a woman who will fight this kind of fight, and there is a super important role for them that can't be filled by men. And while Millie is not the best at rhetoric and does do some sensationalizing, but her counterparts (the protesters) are still below her level in a lot of cases.And possibly a different "reporter"?

I have heard lots of anti-2A people make this argument over the years and they all sound fucking stupid. I would rather die in battle then live as a slave in my own country and kids like this can take it up the ass from a tyranical government if they want to but they aren't going to decide for me. Do they think we would be marching in an open field against tanks like it's the Revolutionary War? The left just doesn’t seem to have any recollection of history. The Vietnam war was won by a bunch of rice farmers against the strongest military the world has even seen. Exactly right. We can point to Afghanistan as an example. Soviets with all their might and military machines were beaten back by cave-dwelling civilians with machine guns. The leftists have probably never picked up a book to not know about guerrilla warfare.Projection.  Just like every other argument they use.  They think because they're too stupid to figure out how to take out a tank that everyone must be.The left just doesn’t seem to have any recollection of history.

I guess libs don't mind hostility towards women when it's against "the enemy", huh? Fuckin pussy.This shitshow is why we don't practice direct democracy and why one must have obtained the age of 25 in order to serve as a US Representative.The irony in the " We got the power" chants. Well, you do have the power, but you're marching to take it away.A perfect summarization in visual form of the complete double-standard, hypocrisy, and disillusionment coming from the "tolerant" left. Honestly this was hard to watch from both angles. That reporter was super cringey too, can’t say I blame her with how the gun grabbers were acting but at the same time we need to take the high ground in this debate.Yeah for sure she should've been loaded with more facts. Guns have saved FAAAAAAR more lives than they take every year. That alone is indisputable. 
 But it does have to be tough being an Infowars reporter. The 2nd cucks were the best. He got so mad when he got trapped. He acted like a little spoiled kid who lost in Mario kartMan-bun-wearing pede here checking in to say I respect your right to this opinion, but I want you to know that I've infiltrated the cucks and they think I'm one of them and it's hilarious when I start dropping truth bombs.I couldn’t even finish the video, listening to that first snowflake libtard was actually giving me cancer.  He’s standing up for “gun safety”, something he himself can’t even explain past thatgod i would LOVE to see one of these people actually stay and have a good solid debate but they ALLL get so fucking mad and just end up walking off screaming. She is also not the best person infowar has for debating.The last two at least wanted to have a discussion... the first group was just human degenerate filth. Dumb as rocks, brainwashed useful idiots w/ nothing to back up their nonsense. Maybe there’s a silver lining to these anti2A temper tantrums. After yesterday’s signing of that ridiculous spending bill I honestly thought well fuck the GOP just lost the House in the midterms. But... if these little shits keep up the virtue signaling then maybe it’ll ignite enough people to still go the polls and vote red.Brave 'pede doing that.

They're so brainwashed by the Marxist public school system that they actually belive they're the guy standing up to the tank in Tianamen Square, when they're actually driving the tank. The irony here is painful, considering what the students in Tiananmen Square were protesting, and the fact that these students know nothing about that.The irony here is painful, considering what the students in Tiananmen Square were protesting, and the fact that these students know nothing about that.Next week: Take away our cell phones to prevent texting and driving deaths. 
Nvm that's inconvient for usIt's literally the exact opposite lol. You don't need a cell phone at all, it's just a convenience. Guns, on the other hand, are not only necessary to maintain a free society, hence the 2nd and "shall not be infringed," but also come in quite handy when an intolerant leftist asshole hits you with a metal bike lock for having a different opinion. You don't need a gun until you need it, but it comes in VERY handy when you do.It's literally the exact opposite lol. You don't need a cell phone at all, it's just a convenience.

Remember when parents threatened to put soap in their kid's mouths if they were bad? Did something happen along the lines where humans started to develop a taste for detergent? Vann Gutier a great American-Arizonan patriot! Everyone should look this guy up I believe hes running for AZ House of Reps. If anyone has any questions about this group (Patriot Movement AZ) ask meYou know what's amazing to me is that, what all of these protests really boil down to are just hatred and disgust for a duly elected President that badly beat a flawed candidate who was promised to win. It's really just mind blowing.How can shitlibs talk shit about guns when it is an upgrade to how they off themselves .v. Tide pods?I wish they’d bring back the original flavor Tide Pods. The green ones are good, but the Orange ones were the tits. Sadly the kids in question do not have a multi-week attention span. We will have to remember for them.Nah they're totally gun experts. How else would they understand the nuances of high capacity assault clips?In reality the number of people who actually ate tide pods is really low which is why this argument is kind of silly.A better argument is why the hell do we care what high school students and people with no life experience have to say, whether they eat soap or not. Raise the voting age.Because they're the ones taking up the torch and there's nothing anyone can do about it. Pissing them off and making them despise the GOP is going to fuck you in the long run.

How about the Hezbollah-cocaine scandal? That's like fast & furious in reverse. Instead of guns going out, cocaine was coming in, and a terrorist group was getting rich off of it.I'm former army. Do you know we were tasked with burning poppy fields of the Taliban early on? Now we have soldiers PROTECTING THEM. Just in time for an opiod epidemic.66000 Americans died from opioid overdose last year. Trump is right. We should be executing the dealers and holding doctors accountable. Makes them more unbearable in the long run because of their tolerances increasing so when the prices start getting higher and higher they get violent. Sure small rebellion here and there can easily be put down, but millions? No better to go to the things that would last for a long time. People need money to get material, food, and other such necessities to live that thoughts about rebellion let alone organizing one would be difficult at best. Debt and making people complacent are the way to go to keeping that herd right where they are needed and wanted.After all if I was a megalomaniac, narcissistic, manipulative, and amoral that is what I would do, and make it a family business with like minded people. Thankfully I am not as for being raised right.[Yes it is extremely high chance that would of happened if I was not raised right.]Canadian infantry vet here, I personally protected poppy fields in south west Kandahar many times during my deployments.That's also where legal pain killers come from. Afghanistan produces something like 90% of the world's poppy if I'm not mistaken.I think it's actually up to 98% now of the world's opium supply comes from Afghanistan. Under the Taliban in 2000-2001 it was at a record low as it was outlawed by the Taliban and being burned up everywhere. Thank goodness we put a stop to that... /sMaybe not guarding them, but there are explicit orders to leave them alone. Really. On top of that, Afghanistan is the WORLDS largest opium producer.Of course we leave them alone; but we prop up governments like Kharzai and send soldiers to defend them becuase our government calls them 'terrorist attacks". Do you know how many men were sent to their deaths over poppies?
It's all underground. Follow the drugs and money and you'll see it.The overly salty soil in Afghanistan that the poppies love is because of a failed American plan to build a hooveresque dam. When I saw the 'Scandal Free' MSM narrative I literally pee'd my pants. Scandal free XD AHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHa"We didn't have a scandal that embarrassed us," Obama said. Sure, there were occasional mistakes and screw-ups, "but there wasn't anything venal in eight years."Oh that makes sense. He wasn't bribed. Even though is administration killed Americans due to terribly poor policies and awful oversight, it wasn't venal. Neat.I don't know about you but I find it neat that Obama didn't get bribed.

Afghanistan produces something like 90% of the world's poppy if I'm not mistaken.I think it's actually up to 98% now of the world's opium supply comes from Afghanistan.

Do you know how many men were sent to their deaths over poppies?
It's all underground. Follow the drugs and money and you'll see it.The overly salty soil in Afghanistan that the poppies love is because of a failed American plan to build a hooveresque dam.

They’ve just turned into a bunch of authoritarian freaks.I used to be liberal because I believe in live and let live.  Modern liberals are the exact opposite.

Remember Obama? "The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet."No matter what the globalists say, Mohamed was a pedo.

If only there were more Imams like this, Islam might actually be making progress towards being a REAL religion of peace.The only way to make Islam religion of peace is to quit Islam. Garbage in garbage out, doesn't matter how much this Iman wants to reform it, it's still garbage if he's sticking with core Islam ideology. There are so many things he needs to change, by the time he's done, it will no longer be recognized as Islam anyway. The only way to make Islam religion of peace is to quit Islam.

That hogg is to brain washed to understand that.He has no clue about real Americans that gave their life for this countrySending guns to murderers is always a bad idea.  Obama sent guns to cartels which they used to kill at least one American, but certainly many Mexicans.  I'm going to assume that Clinton and Obama aren't supporting this movement out of concern for our safety based on the fact that they armed cartels and terrorists.  This is clearly just a movement to use a tragedy to get people to vote democrat, they're pretty clear about thatI agree that sending guns to murderers is always a bad idea and the U.S armed some groups that are just as dangerous as ISIL in the past years, and not just handguns were talking heavy equipment. I just don't see what it has to do with gun control, I see them both as entirely seperate things with seperate solutions. Feel free to educate me if im missing something :)If prove were truly concerned with people's safety and preventing another massacre, there would be more focus on how it happened, and a huge focus on the massive failures at federal and local levels.  We would have clear information about the shooting.  Same with las Vegas, etc.  Instead we have many conflicting reports, obfuscation, and a movement whose leaders actively discouraged criticism of law enforcement failures.  That's not showing a focus on protecting anyone.  It's showing that they want the focus purely on elections.  They are her transparent about that.Then you add all the support from establishment democrats including people who have not only armed terrorists, but sent guns to drug cartels who operate in the US, guns that have turned up in crimes.  How can someone who deliberately armed criminals and terrorists be concerned about protecting people from gun violence?This is just using a tragedy for a political agenda, that's all.  The people backing this have demonstrated that they couldn't care less about gun violence or the effects of their policies.  Obama is a product of the Chicago political machine, he has had Rahm Emmanuel in place there.  How have their strict gun control policies worked?

Along with every British prime minister and pretty much every world leader ever? Arms deals make money, doesn't matter if it's some poor Arabs killing some other poor Arabs, but sometimes (most of the time) it backfires somewhere down the line.Do you really think the left care? They don’t. Both sides are always going to disagree with each other until we have a middle ground but in order to achieve this we seriously need to drain the swamp Republicans and Democrats get the bad ones out. If there is some good MAGA candidates it doesn’t matter if they are Republican or Democrat if they want to make America great again vote those patriots in! We must be serious with ourselves and assess the situation. We must move forward. We must not continue to fuel the fires, for the fires will fuel themselves. Continue to MAGA people. Continue to do the best you can in life, stay with friends and love your family. MAGA is merely a symbol of ourselves. Reflect it! Get out and vote for the REAL candidates who want to MAGA. Republicans and Democrats are the uniparty. It is time for the MAGA party to rise. We must get out and inform our friends and loved ones. The domino effect will take place. We must unite the country not continue to fuel the fire as I said...the fire will fuel themselves. The deep state, I am coming for you. We are all coming for you deep state. Weed has caused no fatal overdoses in US history, but it is illegal. Opioids kill tens of thousands of US citizen and are endorsed by Obama and Hillary.

He knows his capability!If this was truly about preventing another massacre, the first step is to dissect this attack and find out what happened, who fucked up, and hold them accountable.  This movement's leaders are vocally against that because they want the focus on elections.  This is just an retrofitted democrat establishment election ploy, it's not focused on protecting anyone.  I have some very liberal viewpoints. But will never support dems. They don't respect the Constitution.Let's not talk about guns that kill americans. Let's concentrate on guns killing some other guy in some other nations instead.They’re busy infighting over whether trannies count as women or not and how many genders there are. Hint: it’s two.I keep wondering when they’re going to remove the “B” from LGBT, since that suggests there are only two genders.

Those combinations obviously need their own terms.As a lesbian I agree with your statement! It’s definitely a broken ‘community’.

It’s not the swamp or the coup against President Trump.  It’s not our government’s financial malpractice, illegal aliens, or even Muslim barbarism and aggression.  The biggest scandal, the “meta” scandal, is the media’s complicit involvement in all these and many more.What they choose to show how they show it; what they choose to not show; and what they suppress through ridicule, carefully crafted strategy, and poisonous violation of all rules of integrity.  Our western media is in an ideological destructive, one-sided mode as corrosive as that of history’s greatest villains.       Like those villains, they are convinced they are “right” and that crimes are justified in service of their mission.  The true issue here is that too many people use freedom of speech without using freedom of thought first.

American culture is the atithesis to your belief system, so why? "It is estimated that 21% of girls in Pakistan are married before the age of 18." Glad they have exact figures to compare against.  Love that we actually attempt to track shit; that prevalence of child marriage is 8.9%
that laws governing the rights of children under the age of 18 are often contradictory, as they allow girls to marry before age 18 while they are still legal minors, and unable to access services for adults, or exercise adult rights.
that marriages that take place before a girl is aged 18 end in divorce in 70/80% of cases.
that child marriage is associated with a range of mental and physical health consequences in the United States.
The brief concludes that raising the minimum age of marriage without exceptions is the appropriate solution.https://www.girlsnotbrides.org/resource-centre/child-marriage-united-states-serious-problem-simple-first-step-solution/A 17 year old marries an 18 year old in the United States is counted in these "stats" great thing is that in the United States getting divorced for being dumb at 17 won't get you killed.Obviously mentally ill, and should be locked up either in jail for terroristic threats, or in a mental institution for being a lunatic danger to society. No shame in it.  People with Aspergers and Downs syndrome are functioning, productive members of society.  Gender dysphoria is no exception.  The gay community would be doing itself a huge service by distancing itself from the trans element in the LGBTQBBQ community.I dont run in Gay/trans circles, but in business you don't get to choose your associates. Ive spoken with maybe 3-4 gay men in the past few years who are vocal about how ridiculous the trans community is.I'm also of the opinion that trans suicide rates dont have nearly as much to do with societal pressure, and much more to do with the fact they have a mental illness that is leading to these thoughts.At least you can admit to mental illness, there are so many trannies who think what they’re suffering is perfectly acceptable and even normal and in denial of being ill.I'm fine at people being indifferent. Trump is personally indifferent as shit towards transpeople and honestly I love not being pandered and lied to by a politician for once. It's cool when people understand a little even if only on the level that everyone alive has some shit they're going through, we've all got problems. But that's not enough for some people, some people want to slap normies in the face with it and it's just fucking ridiculous.

I know quite a few transwomen in porn and some of the fans are truly wonderful people who, believe it or not, fall all over the political spectrum. Older conservatives, younger liberals, libertarians, Antifa garbage, AltRighters, communists, you name it someome out there is it and likes trans porn. There's stereotypes and many can fall into those too but it's actually really crazy how politically diverse the audience is.Lol it was just some camming in college. You would probably know my friends. Refreshing to see another trans person with similar beliefs. Never got how that was even a thing, I'd literally not want to have sex with someone who didn't want to have sex with me, that's the way it's supposed to work. Dummies like Riley Dennis who give straight people shit for not wanting to fuck a transperson are just agitator assholes.This is 100% accurate and absolutely fine, I see absolutely no infringement on t's & c's either. My ex is trans, she (earned the right for me to call her 'her' because she:) is pro trump, anti Islam, anti lgbt, anti globalist, pro gun, was on our side for gamergate and was just incredibly red pilled in general. She said she thought it is an illness, also that she'd never be really female, but identifying that way and taking the meds was the best she was gonna get. She also despised identify politics and said bullying helped her to a degree develop a tougher shell. I'm a chaser, basically I like biological girls and tgirls. It's a kink. That's all. Traps aren't gay, but they sure as fuck aren't straight either. Both sides are incorrect. I cannot physically/mentally get aroused by males who identify that way. But I've just always had a kink for passable tgirls and when izzie came along, I was basically: dear diaryhowever, she also lost her estranged brother during our relationship through a bike accident and really lost it because the estrogen had essentially put her into female puberty and it was all too much for her, she moved back down south. One of the most beautiful relationships I have ever had. We gamed together, we watched anime, we got really fuckin high and listened to lo-fi and vaporwave, we even skated together.I miss her. And dating is difficult as it is if I wish to go with tgirls rather than biological girls. Good on you you're a chaser and you know it! Yeah people fall all over the Kinsey scale there's nothing wrong with any of it. Yes, it's basically like Puberty II and being around enough trannies at the same stage it's basically junior high all over again. I love that lefties were all "joining the military is a right" over the military thing like lmfao no it isn't they have requirements for a reason. You're banging a dude, which is fine. Which makes you gay, which is also fine, but please don't delude yourself into thinking a man who got his dick removed is a female. Just saying.Lol yep. I too, am bi for traps that are extremely feminine. I've never told anyone. It's not because I'm not out of the closet though. It's because I don't really see the need to make a huge deal out of it like these smug, self-absorbed cafe communists.This is such a low effort troll I gotta wonder if you're here on your day off of your job at Media Matters.If it looks like a woman, acts like a woman,  and sounds like a woman, being attracted to it doesn't make you gay.It's a pretty wierd sexuality. You like women still, but this is a mentally ill dude that looks like a woman and would fool you if you didn't know what was dangling between the legs. You wouldn't be attracted to the opposite, a woman that looks like a man. Because you aren't attracted to men.I'm saying if you go to bar, hit up some chick, take her home to bang, but then find out she has a penis... you aren't a homosexual just for that. Call it off at that point and and send him packin,  yer straight. Find out about the penis and have sex anyway? Not straight,  but not full on homo either.  You didn't go out looking for dudes.I’m for equal treatment, not special treatment. I’m pretty sure most of us are that way. You seem to want to return to discrimination over things you don’t agree with.Non-PC isn’t discrimination, it just means you get treated like everybody else, and we’re not going to fall all over ourselves to make sure you feel included and accepted because of arbitrary characteristics that don’t mean jack shit in the grand scheme of things.It’s kinda like that Paul Hogan movie where he’s an angel (can’t remember the name offhand and too lazy to look it up), and there’s this guy in a wheelchair who’s a massive asshole to everybody, yet they take it because he’s disabled. Paul Hogan finally has enough of his shit, sits down in a chair (so they’re equals) and punches him right in the face.And that was exactly what he needed, because at that moment he finally felt equal to everyone else. He was an asshole because everybody pussy-footed and tiptoed around him because of his condition, when he really just wanted to be treated like a normal person.You really don't understand it but I don't expect you to. Ignorance is bliss I suppose. I'm not gay, how izzie described chasers were bi but not attracted to men as in the male form. Hence the kink has to be passable trans. There had always been niche that have this kink. Sexuality is different from gender and I think everyone is on the spectrum to some degree. And he who does protest too much is typically hiding something, I bet you're straight as they come right? I think he considered her a "she" because she transitioned, as in got a fake vagina and acted and lived as a woman.And by the way mate, I've tried to force myself to watch proper gay porn, it made me Cringe and I couldn't watch it, my dick was never gonna get hard. It's the psychological side of sexuality. What gets us off. It's the kink that they look like a girl but they're not. It's like bi sexual, gay, straight, the rest, I'm comfortable with who I am. Had no issue with my sexuality, things would be easier if I was gay because gays always hit on me. No way man that's like 50% of my torrents if I stopped doing that I wouldn't get to come here and wash away my sins while helping power Kek's meme magic. It's not like I pay for it.Porn? Easier said than done. Porn hits on our primal urges, arguably the most important primal urge. We're animals after all.Is it necessary to categorize this as a pathology? I just don't understand why people with gender dysphoria can't be just accepted as they are. I don't see that medical procedures to "reassign sex" are helpful or ethical, but I don't want to just call people sick either. I also don't want to be forced to call someone by their preferred pronouns. Before this got polticized I knew transgender people and I called them by preferred pronouns because it seemed the kind thing to do. Maybe it feels like a pathology or mental illness? Do you suppose trannies in societies that have a place for "third gender" people feel okay and not mentally ill?If I decided I am truly a one armed man, despite being born with two arms, and I decide to have one of my arms amputated so I can live as a one-armed man, am I a mentally healthy person? I disagree on the ethics point. I'm pretty big on the idea that an adult in this country is free to do whatever they want up to and including harm to themselves so long as nothing they do brings harm or potential harm to someone else. And even if we could agree on something like that, our own arbitrary feelings on what constitutes "harm" probably won't be the same. I think what you mean with the difference between how you feel about pronouns then vs now goes back to what I said about jamming this shit down people's throats. People get spiteful over it, I don't want anyone resenting me but every time something dumb like making misgendering a criminal offense it makes all of us look bad.I agree with you in that I have no problem with someone choosing to modify their body in whatever way they want. But the medical community in any particular country has to make a decision over whether this is what's best for patients if trangenderism is going to be seen as a medical condition. You might have the right to modify your body but doctors also have rights and responsibilities. Surgery being the treatment should be reviewed, IMO. Increased likelihood to become suicidal is a pretty good yardstick for whether a treatment is helpful or harmful. I would grant, though, that looking at things statistically might not be fair for all individuals. I still don't see that this needs to be seen as a medical or mental problem. Maybe people that choose to transition could be seen as opting for a series of elective cosmetic surgeries, no different from a woman that chooses to have breast enhancement or reduction surgery for personal aesthetic reasons or someone that chooses to have liposuction. You are begging the question. The question is whether "transwomen" are, in fact, women - and then you argue that we should accept them "as they are" (in your estimation, as women). I do not accept your premise; to me, accepting them as they are is accepting that they are cross-dressing men with mental disorders. To me, accepting a person who hears voices in his head is accepting that he has schizophrenia. I would never tell him that it is actually God telling him to kill his parents. So that what it pretty much boils down to. I'm not going to participate in their ideology and I don't care if it pisses them off. There are so many ideologies out there that I'm guaranteed to piss one of them off no matter what I do.I wouldn’t go dancing a jig waving a chocolate bar in the face of someone with diabetes, or mock a person with depression saying “oh boo hoo, weak bitch.”You’ve got a good heart bro but there are two types of mentally ill people, those who seek help to get better and those who use their illness to get extra privileges and attention. Think combat ptsd vs. this dick; or legit MDD vs reee. And if a psychotic person was screaming in the street for attention, still wouldn’t mock them. Might have to taser them to get them into custody, but that’s just practicality, not an excess of being spiteful or mean. We have transgender folks among us in this MAGA thing, and while I don’t think the medical establishment is doing them any favors by treating them with hormones and surgery (just as we wouldn’t treat an anorexic with diet pills and liposuction) I also don’t think that the lesson of Matthew 25:45 applies any less. Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult. On the contrary, repay evil with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing.For whoever would love life and see good days must keep their tongue from evil and their lips from deceitful speech.For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their prayer, but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.I don’t think you quite get the point, which is that the loving thing is to tell the truth, playing along with delusion doesn’t help anyone. Which is the whole pronoun insanity. http://reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/86wzp9/transgender_proudly_admits_to_drugging_attendees/dw8srrhWhen I was 7 I used to pretend I was a ninja.

No shame in it.  People with Aspergers and Downs syndrome are functioning, productive members of society.  Gender dysphoria is no exception.  The gay community would be doing itself a huge service by distancing itself from the trans element in the LGBTQBBQ community.I dont run in Gay/trans circles, but in business you don't get to choose your associates. Ive spoken with maybe 3-4 gay men in the past few years who are vocal about how ridiculous the trans community is.I'm also of the opinion that trans suicide rates dont have nearly as much to do with societal pressure, and much more to do with the fact they have a mental illness that is leading to these thoughts.At least you can admit to mental illness, there are so many trannies who think what they’re suffering is perfectly acceptable and even normal and in denial of being ill.I'm fine at people being indifferent.

Had no issue with my sexuality, things would be easier if I was gay because gays always hit on me. No way man that's like 50% of my torrents if I stopped doing that I wouldn't get to come here and wash away my sins while helping power Kek's meme magic. It's not like I pay for it.Porn? Easier said than done. Porn hits on our primal urges, arguably the most important primal urge. We're animals after all.Is it necessary to categorize this as a pathology? I just don't understand why people with gender dysphoria can't be just accepted as they are. I don't see that medical procedures to "reassign sex" are helpful or ethical, but I don't want to just call people sick either. I also don't want to be forced to call someone by their preferred pronouns. Before this got polticized I knew transgender people and I called them by preferred pronouns because it seemed the kind thing to do. Maybe it feels like a pathology or mental illness? Do you suppose trannies in societies that have a place for "third gender" people feel okay and not mentally ill?If I decided I am truly a one armed man, despite being born with two arms, and I decide to have one of my arms amputated so I can live as a one-armed man, am I a mentally healthy person? I disagree on the ethics point. I'm pretty big on the idea that an adult in this country is free to do whatever they want up to and including harm to themselves so long as nothing they do brings harm or potential harm to someone else. And even if we could agree on something like that, our own arbitrary feelings on what constitutes "harm" probably won't be the same. I think what you mean with the difference between how you feel about pronouns then vs now goes back to what I said about jamming this shit down people's throats. People get spiteful over it, I don't want anyone resenting me but every time something dumb like making misgendering a criminal offense it makes all of us look bad.I agree with you in that I have no problem with someone choosing to modify their body in whatever way they want. But the medical community in any particular country has to make a decision over whether this is what's best for patients if trangenderism is going to be seen as a medical condition. You might have the right to modify your body but doctors also have rights and responsibilities. Surgery being the treatment should be reviewed, IMO. Increased likelihood to become suicidal is a pretty good yardstick for whether a treatment is helpful or harmful. I would grant, though, that looking at things statistically might not be fair for all individuals. I still don't see that this needs to be seen as a medical or mental problem. Maybe people that choose to transition could be seen as opting for a series of elective cosmetic surgeries, no different from a woman that chooses to have breast enhancement or reduction surgery for personal aesthetic reasons or someone that chooses to have liposuction. You are begging the question. The question is whether "transwomen" are, in fact, women - and then you argue that we should accept them "as they are" (in your estimation, as women). I do not accept your premise; to me, accepting them as they are is accepting that they are cross-dressing men with mental disorders. To me, accepting a person who hears voices in his head is accepting that he has schizophrenia. I would never tell him that it is actually God telling him to kill his parents. So that what it pretty much boils down to. I'm not going to participate in their ideology and I don't care if it pisses them off. There are so many ideologies out there that I'm guaranteed to piss one of them off no matter what I do.No shame in it.  People with Aspergers and Downs syndrome are functioning, productive members of society.  Gender dysphoria is no exception.  The gay community would be doing itself a huge service by distancing itself from the trans element in the LGBTQBBQ community.I dont run in Gay/trans circles, but in business you don't get to choose your associates. Ive spoken with maybe 3-4 gay men in the past few years who are vocal about how ridiculous the trans community is.I'm also of the opinion that trans suicide rates dont have nearly as much to do with societal pressure, and much more to do with the fact they have a mental illness that is leading to these thoughts.The gay community would be doing itself a huge service by distancing itself from the trans element in the LGBTQBBQ community.I dont run in Gay/trans circles, but in business you don't get to choose your associates.

Trump is personally indifferent as shit towards transpeople and honestly I love not being pandered and lied to by a politician for once. It's cool when people understand a little even if only on the level that everyone alive has some shit they're going through, we've all got problems. But that's not enough for some people, some people want to slap normies in the face with it and it's just fucking ridiculous. Does nothing but makes people spiteful and I'm p tired of it."But if we treat you like a normal human with a medical condition then we can't fetisize you. Its not fair to us perverts, forget about what is right for you. Trans people should be glorified and pandered to so that its easier for me to fap to them." -average democratWhile I completely agree with your sentiment and I get where you're going, truth be told those perverts can be pretty great. I know quite a few transwomen in porn and some of the fans are truly wonderful people who, believe it or not, fall all over the political spectrum. Older conservatives, younger liberals, libertarians, Antifa garbage, AltRighters, communists, you name it someome out there is it and likes trans porn. There's stereotypes and many can fall into those too but it's actually really crazy how politically diverse the audience is.Lol it was just some camming in college.

Never got how that was even a thing, I'd literally not want to have sex with someone who didn't want to have sex with me, that's the way it's supposed to work. Dummies like Riley Dennis who give straight people shit for not wanting to fuck a transperson are just agitator assholes.Never got how that was even a thing, I'd literally not want to have sex with someone who didn't want to have sex with me, that's the way it's supposed to work. Dummies like Riley Dennis who give straight people shit for not wanting to fuck a transperson are just agitator assholes.This is 100% accurate and absolutely fine, I see absolutely no infringement on t's & c's either. My ex is trans, she (earned the right for me to call her 'her' because she:) is pro trump, anti Islam, anti lgbt, anti globalist, pro gun, was on our side for gamergate and was just incredibly red pilled in general. She said she thought it is an illness, also that she'd never be really female, but identifying that way and taking the meds was the best she was gonna get. She also despised identify politics and said bullying helped her to a degree develop a tougher shell. I'm a chaser, basically I like biological girls and tgirls. It's a kink. That's all. Traps aren't gay, but they sure as fuck aren't straight either. Both sides are incorrect. I cannot physically/mentally get aroused by males who identify that way. But I've just always had a kink for passable tgirls and when izzie came along, I was basically: dear diaryhowever, she also lost her estranged brother during our relationship through a bike accident and really lost it because the estrogen had essentially put her into female puberty and it was all too much for her, she moved back down south. One of the most beautiful relationships I have ever had. We gamed together, we watched anime, we got really fuckin high and listened to lo-fi and vaporwave, we even skated together.I miss her. And dating is difficult as it is if I wish to go with tgirls rather than biological girls. Good on you you're a chaser and you know it! Yeah people fall all over the Kinsey scale there's nothing wrong with any of it. Yes, it's basically like Puberty II and being around enough trannies at the same stage it's basically junior high all over again. I love that lefties were all "joining the military is a right" over the military thing like lmfao no it isn't they have requirements for a reason. You're banging a dude, which is fine. Which makes you gay, which is also fine, but please don't delude yourself into thinking a man who got his dick removed is a female. Just saying.Lol yep. I too, am bi for traps that are extremely feminine. I've never told anyone. It's not because I'm not out of the closet though. It's because I don't really see the need to make a huge deal out of it like these smug, self-absorbed cafe communists.This is such a low effort troll I gotta wonder if you're here on your day off of your job at Media Matters.If it looks like a woman, acts like a woman,  and sounds like a woman, being attracted to it doesn't make you gay.It's a pretty wierd sexuality. You like women still, but this is a mentally ill dude that looks like a woman and would fool you if you didn't know what was dangling between the legs. You wouldn't be attracted to the opposite, a woman that looks like a man. Because you aren't attracted to men.I'm saying if you go to bar, hit up some chick, take her home to bang, but then find out she has a penis... you aren't a homosexual just for that. Call it off at that point and and send him packin,  yer straight. Find out about the penis and have sex anyway? Not straight,  but not full on homo either.  You didn't go out looking for dudes.I’m for equal treatment, not special treatment. I’m pretty sure most of us are that way. You seem to want to return to discrimination over things you don’t agree with.Non-PC isn’t discrimination, it just means you get treated like everybody else, and we’re not going to fall all over ourselves to make sure you feel included and accepted because of arbitrary characteristics that don’t mean jack shit in the grand scheme of things.It’s kinda like that Paul Hogan movie where he’s an angel (can’t remember the name offhand and too lazy to look it up), and there’s this guy in a wheelchair who’s a massive asshole to everybody, yet they take it because he’s disabled. Paul Hogan finally has enough of his shit, sits down in a chair (so they’re equals) and punches him right in the face.And that was exactly what he needed, because at that moment he finally felt equal to everyone else. He was an asshole because everybody pussy-footed and tiptoed around him because of his condition, when he really just wanted to be treated like a normal person.You really don't understand it but I don't expect you to. Ignorance is bliss I suppose. I'm not gay, how izzie described chasers were bi but not attracted to men as in the male form. Hence the kink has to be passable trans. There had always been niche that have this kink. Sexuality is different from gender and I think everyone is on the spectrum to some degree. And he who does protest too much is typically hiding something, I bet you're straight as they come right? I think he considered her a "she" because she transitioned, as in got a fake vagina and acted and lived as a woman.And by the way mate, I've tried to force myself to watch proper gay porn, it made me Cringe and I couldn't watch it, my dick was never gonna get hard.

I wouldn’t go dancing a jig waving a chocolate bar in the face of someone with diabetes, or mock a person with depression saying “oh boo hoo, weak bitch.”You’ve got a good heart bro but there are two types of mentally ill people, those who seek help to get better and those who use their illness to get extra privileges and attention. Think combat ptsd vs. this dick; or legit MDD vs reee. And if a psychotic person was screaming in the street for attention, still wouldn’t mock them. Might have to taser them to get them into custody, but that’s just practicality, not an excess of being spiteful or mean. We have transgender folks among us in this MAGA thing, and while I don’t think the medical establishment is doing them any favors by treating them with hormones and surgery (just as we wouldn’t treat an anorexic with diet pills and liposuction) I also don’t think that the lesson of Matthew 25:45 applies any less. Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult. On the contrary, repay evil with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing.For whoever would love life and see good days must keep their tongue from evil and their lips from deceitful speech.For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their prayer, but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.I don’t think you quite get the point, which is that the loving thing is to tell the truth, playing along with delusion doesn’t help anyone. Which is the whole pronoun insanity. http://reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/86wzp9/transgender_proudly_admits_to_drugging_attendees/dw8srrhthen starbucks needs to sue to shut her up.

Even if this sick pusswad didn't do it, just threatening it is illegal, and for good reason.I mean I am actually an endocrinologist so, ya know, you could but that's somewhat out of my area of expertise.Well without giving up a significant amount of personal information I unfortunately can't prove it, but I assure you I am. I tend to not make my personal medical history known online, so I'm not entirely sure where you're getting that idea from. From a medical standpoint, no. I'm hesitant to make a specific medical claim without actually knowing this person, but based on what little I've seen, I'm confident about that much.Hey, I guess it's okay with you, but I would rather this thing not swizzle it's mutilated junk in my double chocolate chip frappacino, aight?And I really don't want it to put some kind of weird hormone shit in my drink that might kill me, or ruin my new kidney.Ain't nothing funny about this shit.

You want to be a transgender and do something that is like this to fulfill your sick agenda, your an object hence the it and not even a person.this is why I oppose tranny ideology so strongly. They wanna get revenge on the normal people in the world and make us all gender-confused.This post should be pinned. As should've posts about Trump standing up to this sexual communism with his ban!this is why I oppose tranny ideology so strongly. They wanna get revenge on the normal people in the world and make us all gender-confused.This person's true cancer is being leftist. Notice how they are improperly medicating conservatives? A tranny agenda lol. Now I've heard it all. Atleast it would be easy to get organized considering there are dozens of usThis is not the only story I've seen for tranny's and leftists tampering with people's Foods. They get off on this shitthis is why I oppose tranny ideology so strongly. They wanna get revenge on the normal people in the world and make us all gender-confused.This person's true cancer is being leftist. Notice how they are improperly medicating conservatives? First of all no tranny has spare estradiol that's fucking stupid. If society breaks down, believe me it'll be like The Gathering and all of us trannies are fighting to the death, winner gets everyone else's hormones and blockers.But where what she's doing gets particularly devious is it could be enough to to wreak havoc on a woman's system. Birth control for instance is like 20 micrograms a day. 20 micrograms a day for three weeks, placebo for one week. That week is what a cycle ends up falling into because of 20 micrograms a day. Stuff's only got a half-life of like 12 hours in our pills, I think a week's time in birth control. But if low dose estrogen can do that, imagine what 2MG of estradiol could do.If this bitch is actually doing this I honestly hope she gets years on each count she gets, served consecutively. And throw in another five just for making the rest of us trannies look bad.I don't know much about that reaction honestly we pretty much run the risk of clotting at a drop of a hat on the stuff, I woulda figured a blood thinner would cancel that out.Not to give liberal lunatics any ideas, but drugging men with a high dose of an aromatase inhibitor and crashing their estradiol would be a lot worse (for a few days at least until enzyme function returns to baseline).Low E2 feels like shit and is undesirable for muscle building, as estrogen is anabolic. Slightly elevated E2 feels pretty nice (as long as testosterone is high). I don't know much about that reaction honestly we pretty much run the risk of clotting at a drop of a hat on the stuff, I woulda figured a blood thinner would cancel that out.I don't know much about that reaction honestly we pretty much run the risk of clotting at a drop of a hat on the stuff, I woulda figured a blood thinner would cancel that out.Not to give liberal lunatics any ideas, but drugging men with a high dose of an aromatase inhibitor and crashing their estradiol would be a lot worse (for a few days at least until enzyme function returns to baseline).Low E2 feels like shit and is undesirable for muscle building, as estrogen is anabolic. Slightly elevated E2 feels pretty nice (as long as testosterone is high). They are sex hormones they won't turn you into a suicidal lefty. Realistically it won't do anything but it is a clear waste of medication people could be using and it's fucked up like their belief system. So, does this creature have a cock?  I can't keep track of what transgender is supposed to mean anymore.This person needs to go to prison for a long time if this is real. I don't have anything against trans people, I believe people have the right to live their life how they see fit. The fact that they're trans doesn't really enter into it, it's the poisoning that's wrong. It was real until about 3 minutes ago when they apparently deleted their twitter account after a ton of tweets were tagging them to @starbucks with their illegal bullshit.To bad the internet is forever and archives and screen shots of their bullshit have already been saved and shared.It was real until about 3 minutes ago when they apparently deleted their twitter account after a ton of tweets were tagging them to @starbucks with their illegal bullshit.To bad the internet is forever and archives and screen shots of their bullshit have already been saved and shared.They're not sending their best trannies. We are. We have the best trannies, with the thickest, most feminine cocks.Statisticly hardly anyone is trans. Therefore we need to be on our best behavior. Why do fucking idiots like this exist and make us all look fucking retarded.Martin skrelli got fucked for asking for a lock of hair from a side of beef yet this creature can brag about this shit?Has to beg online for "Facial feminization" surgery. Doubt s/he'll get anywhere close to what's needed, even less likely a crowd-funded vaginoplasty will be around the corner. Most likely will be a part of the "women have dicks, too!" crowd.Has to beg online for "Facial feminization" surgery. Doubt s/he'll get anywhere close to what's needed, even less likely a crowd-funded vaginoplasty will be around the corner. Most likely will be a part of the "women have dicks, too!" crowd."I don't want to actually be held responsible for my actions, I just want people to acknowledge how good of a person I am!!"Disgusting. So many transgenders have criminal tendencies it seems. (Remember the Uber driver who spent time in prison for armed robbery? Transgenders abusing kids in restrooms?)How far in the echo chamber do you have to be that you think you can publicly brag about committing a crime on Twitter and think nothing will happen to you?Can also be very detrimental to an ER-positive breast cancer patient. "Cancer cells grow in response to estrogen".  If true then an arrest and law suit may be appropriate action.Im concerned about the male contraceptive  pill.. I said it last week, wonder who will be the first liberaltard to put this in the starcucks coffee. What a psychopath. Threatening to use chemicals to cause severe and lasting damage to someone's body is terrorism, not activism.Not one person who is happy with themselves would do something like this. The dude hates himself and now turns his aggression on other people. He made his bed now he going to sleep in it. Edit: well maybe he’s just fucked up, you gotta beReminds me of the sodomite Dan Savage proudly confessing he volunteered at an election night for a Republican politician when he had the flu, licking doorknobs when nobody was looking in hopes to get the politician sick. Haha I knew someone would say something like this. There is other stuff I can say about em  but I'll raise the SJWs (everyone has a little SJW in them) outa many here.The extraction of same-sex attraction from the DSM-V was a political one. It wasn't scientific nor philosophical. Similair with Obergefell vs Hodges: little actual  judicial reasoning. Same thing is slowly happening to transgenderism. For transgenderism it was known as Gender Identity Disorder but now the label is Gender Identity Dysphoria. Notice the word change that makes it more "friendly" and less of a mental issue but a bodily one, hence the steady push of normalizing transgenderism (the fucking sect has its own flag ... lol as if the rainbow flag wasn't enough) by pediatricians, academia and rank-and-file LGBT+ advocates."Help these poor souls! They're just in the wrong body! They weren't ASKED if they wanted the body they were born in! If they were only ASKED then their pronouns wouldn't be mistaken!"Haha I knew someone would say something like this.

Doesn't matter. Imagine somebody on Twitter joking about spiking women's drinks with testosterone pills at a lesbian conference or whatever. Supposedly "she's" joking. Doesn't matter. Imagine somebody on Twitter joking about spiking women's drinks with testosterone pills at a lesbian conference or whatever. As soon as the Florida shooting happened, the dems stopped talking about daca and focused on gun control again. It’s almost like the shooting was the the out they were looking for. No kids involved with Vegas = no media "hook".  Worst mass shooting in US history, and it's gone from the headlines in a week, two tops. On top of the fact that the FBI had to cover up a gun running op gone bad, take a look at who the victims predominately were from the Vegas massacre: white conservatives.They don't have any victim status at all. Hell, we saw plenty of libshits on twitter saying that the Vegas shooting was justified because the people in attendance of the concert were likely 2nd Amendment supporters. Also doesn't hurt that the FBI is trying to cover up an illegal gun deal with the Saudis that went tits-up the guy was killed and a couple of Saudis opened up on the crowd.Why would media report leftist terrorism incidents? Texas church shooting, Vegas, congressional baseball game. Leftists have really stepped up their terrorism/mass murder game. Can't have that as the narrative. Alright guys, I guess I'll have to hide in my attic from now on, Anne Frankly it's pretty nice up there.It's funny because there was a BLM protest today in Sacramento, but you wouldn't know it if you looked at CNN's top headlines right now.  No longer media darlings.  I'm not seeing this on the actual Wikipedia page. I searched for Evertown and only see one instance of it, and it isn't the quote OP posted. Has it been edited? What I want to know is why conservative groups aren't doing the same damned thing. It's totally stupid not to. It's a huge fundraising opportunity, it creates energy, and it puts your side on offense.Why does the NRA just sit there and take punches? Why aren't they organizing an NRA member rally? Why aren't they up in the faces of the people pushing this? They need a copy of Saul Alinsky.Why don't any other conservative groups do this? They had groups waiting to pounce to grab whatever kids they could and make them spokespeople. It's not like we can't do this too. I can't believe that no one on here works for ANY conservative grassroots group and can ram this message into their skulls. The way to raise money is to get out there and make noise. That's what convinces billionaires to give you money and that's what makes your direct mail campaigns work. The RNC should be doing what the DNC does, too: turning every single special election into a big e-mail and fundraising push as we try to CONTEST EVERY SEAT just like the other side does. You raise more money that way - but somehow our guys can't figure it out. GOP doesn't want to win, plain and simple.  We can't rely on them.  I was making the argument here last night that we need our own MAGA infrastructure and funding.  Us pedes are majorly frustrated and pissed off at our Congress.  This is not going to turn into votes for our side when the midterms get here.  Our turnout is going to suffer.  The GOP isn't doing shit to get people out to the polls as far as I can tell.  We have no sense of urgency, even here on T_D.  In my opinion Posts about the midterms should be top priority from now until November.  And no, r /thecongress isn't the answer, we need eyeballs on this information.Don't even get me started on our lack of MAGA candidates who could primary the GOP hacks.  We have no one viable as far as I can tell.  Fucking thing sucksWe need to start doing what the other side does I think. Start turning EVERY special election into a fight. It doesn't matter if we think we're going to win or not. We have to get into the fight every time because it builds energy. That's enough for me. We've got to start doing what we did for the 2016 election again. Get in the fight. Turn on the weaponized autism against the open borders Democrat who's trying to steal this seat in Arizona. Start pushing the threads the same way we did last time. Then fight the next seat, and the next.We had a guy try to piggyback off Trump to primary my congressman, he turned out to be a wifebeating piece of shit that would've lost to the democrat candidate HARD. So even people who seem like MAGA candidates on the surface need A LOT of scrutiny.Which means they have to be on our sub for months and months before elections so we can extremely vet them.  Oh, the cherry on top was him claiming to be an Army Ranger with combat deployments, turned out he washed out of Ranger school and was stationed in Germany.As soon as the Florida shooting happened, the dems stopped talking about daca and focused on gun control again.

The Obamanation = Progressive ultra leftist movements masquerading as community organizing for social rights movements. What are you talking about?  This is clearly a spontaneous, organic movement by the most intelligent, passionate children in America.Completely grass roots. The kids are our future. How dare you disagree with them? They’ll remember this.Completely grass roots. The kids are our future. How dare you disagree with them? They’ll remember this.I mentioned this hours ago and it got deleted from another sub. Soros has his money deep in those orgs. I saw the Everytown logo on one of the banners at the DC rally and immediately knew what we were in for.They've collected over $600,000,000? The only way that could be possible is through George Soros and Jeff Bezos!Professional concert stages, with jumbotrons and. branded  banners don’t build themselves, and top-name pop stars just don’t show up. As I used to chide my lefty friends, “just who has to book the buses for the spontaneous demonstrations?”  There is professional organization and big money in this.it's obvious by their words and actions and scripted media appearances that these kids were groomed for this role before the shooting ever happened. Nazi Soros and nazi islamic terrorist supporter Louis Farrakhan are behind these anti Second Amendment marches.  It was the Antifa revolution they had planned for last November 4th, but they had postponed.  It was backed by nazi Soros, Hollyweird hypocrites and crazy nazis all over the world, fluffed by Hillary Clinton, Obama and the deep state.  They even had marchers globally.... asking for the USA to disarm?  Really stupid. They are the new Nazi Youth.  Very lame.  Will guarantee a red wave this November.  Democrat Losers.Yep. This protest was made up of the same pussyhat marchers organized by the same groups. They just brought their soyfed kids with them this time.  They have advertised that this march is NOT politically motivated... If ActBlue is collecting the funds, 3.95% of everything donated for this movement goes to Democratic coffers to fund Democratic candidates.https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/86zauk/this_is_spicy_if_the_march_for_our_lives_was_a/?ref=share&ref_source=linkhttps://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/86zauk/this_is_spicy_if_the_march_for_our_lives_was_a/?ref=share&ref_source=link"As of April 2016, ActBlue had raised more than $1.1 billion for Democratic candidates and progressive organizations at various levels of politics, making it the largest fundraising tool in United States politics."NOW, they are imprisoned for insulting a foreign, low-IQ culture that has achieved naught but bloodshed.You know all those crazies that claim white cavemen stole all their best innovations from a much more advanced black culture?Yeah. After a couple years of watching Europe, I can somewhat understand how someone might think that outcome was even possible.And now the entire country is full of Muslim rape gangs that abuse thousands of underage girls. A real fucking rape culture yet not a word from fucking libreals on this.Yep. I currently live in a country where you can get thrown in jail for speech crimes for 10 years. That's why im an NRA member even though im not even American.You know all those crazies that claim white cavemen stole all their best innovations from a much more advanced black culture?Yeah.

S. has...after all, we had to literally fight a revolutionary war to get such protections.  But the idea of arresting people because they said mean things on the internet would have sounded absolutely crazy in the U. K. even five years ago.  Congratulations, faux-left, the horribly oppressive U. K. you imagined in "V for Vendetta" is now absolutely real, but it came under the guise of your own fucking faux-liberalism.  What I’m onto is why so many western cultures could all be so wrong all at once. You’ve got the policies of the UK, US, Canada, France, Germany, Sweden, Australia, etc. The UK is leading our part, what about Sweden or Germany? Quite clearly each of our nations has the same political slant and it must end. Oops they made a mistake. Life could go on if they would let it.My guess is the Queen is keeping calm and carrying on when she should be flailing her arms about and barking orders.There are powers in play that have been trying to take down the Christian 'empire' (Western Civilization) for a long long time.No, it's not the Jews. That would be silly since a) Jews are safe in Christian nations b) Jews are prosperous in those nations and c) Jesus was a Jew so there's a bond. Pretty much we wouldn't want to bite the hand that has been so kind.However, Islam certainly tried to destroy it once... Islam has been very open about wanting to take down Christians (and Jews) specifically. Islamic nations worked with Hitler.I think it's also just evil statists. There are the statists that believe statism is good, and then there are the statists that simply use the state for their own gain. Perhaps this is the natural progression of liberal (classical sense of the word) societies. Globalism open borders Soros is everywhere liberalism Obama championed it throughout the world so did Hollywood and our media.Yet in the UK there are no statues being torn down, no erasing of history. We may have many problems, but what is happening in the US is just as worrying.You are of course right to point out that the U. S., despite having free speech constitutionally protected, is facing some real challenges to that idea these days.  Thanks for adding in that perspective.  But the idea of arresting people because they said mean things on the internet would have sounded absolutely crazy in the U. K. even five years ago.During that timespan, this was happening in Russia, when the "Offence of believers' feelings law" was pushed. Sure, Christians and non-Caucasus Muslims are not violent, but the first ones can be seriously corrupted, and calling them out for it on social media can give them the reason to make police knock at your doorstep.Without free speech protections, the whims and tastes of what is allowed by those in power can change quickly.  Today they're arresting people for politically-incorrect speech, a few years from now it could be for Qur'an ownership.  A country either has free speech or doesn't, and if doesn't, any speech is always potentially bannable.  just goes to show how wise and courageous our founding fathers were in making america. history is repeating itself over seasThat goes against every single fiber of my being. Maybe it was a peacenik Nana that instilled American values into me or Ron Paul explaining Liberty. What I’m onto is why so many western cultures could all be so wrong all at once.

A country either has free speech or doesn't, and if doesn't, any speech is always potentially bannable.  just goes to show how wise and courageous our founding fathers were in making america. history is repeating itself over seasThat goes against every single fiber of my being. Maybe it was a peacenik Nana that instilled American values into me or Ron Paul explaining Liberty.

But the idea of arresting people because they said mean things on the internet would have sounded absolutely crazy in the U. K. even five years ago.During that timespan, this was happening in Russia, when the "Offence of believers' feelings law" was pushed. Sure, Christians and non-Caucasus Muslims are not violent, but the first ones can be seriously corrupted, and calling them out for it on social media can give them the reason to make police knock at your doorstep.Gun control is an integral part of Europe and has been for centuries.  This is how it works: If you want to have an aristocracy, you need a peasant class.  You can't have a peasant class if they're armed, thus a disarmed peasantry is deeply embedded in the culture of Europe.And apparently america doesn't have any poor people..

I think the government there is doing this on purpose to get their political enemies killed without doing it themselves.https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2498913/man-jailed-for-leaving-bacon-sandwiches-outside-a-mosque-found-dead-in-prison-half-way-through-sentence/Cause of death; unknown.

The EU members all have the same law: the govt can imprison you for any speech it likes and you can appeal to the EU Court of Human Rights for a decision - good luck.Well at least their police protect them from cultural rape gangs and being slaughtered on city stree.... ohHe was allegedly working for the FBI at the same time as MI6 if you read the FBI statements about his "dossier" and previous material.

Brits gave up their guns after WW1, but the NRA actually gathered shipped 7,000 rifles to them so they could defend themselves against Nazis. After the war the stupid cucks rounded up and destroyed all the guns, like nothing bad would ever happen again after WW2“The U.S. National Rifle Association collected and shipped large numbers of privately donated rifles for use by the Home Guard. These were collected and destroyed after the war.”I wont preach to you, you can obviously dictate policy choices for your own country based on the gun crime stats. I personally think they are far too high for a first world nation.Im not a snivveling lefty and i realise criminality will take another form, but if you look at the last few terror attacks in the UK... they weren't able to get guns and therefore the public could attempt to kick the fuckers heads in without that added fear. Something to consider.The second amendment is not about the crimes of the citizens. It's about the agents of the state being damn sure about their application of power and I support it fully. Are you that retarded?  You don't even understand the meaning of "autistic", yet you say I can't comprehend...  LMAO.Sounds like your liberal hive hasn't told you about the people being imprisoned for social media posts in the UK.

Meh... Democrats think he should be able to decide if he can inject himself with hormones to look more feminine.... but an 18 year old isn't competent enough to buy a gun.Since everyone's lives see plastered all over face book, this kid can look back and be embarrassed for his motherMeh... Democrats think he should be able to decide if he can inject himself with hormones to look more feminine.... but an 18 year old isn't competent enough to buy a gun.I went to public school, so I knew all the good cuss words by this kid’s age but if I had ever dared to even write the word “fuck” and my parents saw it they would have beat the cheeks off my ass in an instant. No wonder kids are growing up with a complete lack of respect. Restraining your language does more for you than people think. It goes deeper than just not cussing, but it also teaches you to control your temper and maintain your composure when others are losing it. It's a good habit even in adulthood. I agree I decided to stop cursing when I found out I was going to have a daughter when I was 17 years old. I haven't since then and I'm 35 now. I don't even know what it's like anymore and don't regret it in the slightest. Don't get me wrong I don't think down on anyone who does. I just decided I wouldn't and always told my kids the reason I don't is because in my mind if I curse it just means I wasn't intelligent enough to get my point across in a better way. I know that isn't true in the fact that many brilliant people have mouths like sailors, but having that mind set has done me and my children very well throughout the years. My son who is 14 now I truly believe uses what I've taught him and manages his language in the same way. Another thing I have learned is that many people of come across in my life has really respected the fact that I don't curse. Even my friends since I was a kid who most all of them curse regularly have always held me in great respect for my ability to refrain from harsh language. If my son was to start doing it when he gets older I wouldn't be surprised nor would it bother me to much. My 17 year old daughter who is graduating high school this year I know for sure does but doesn't do it often, so I wouldn't be surprised if my son would follow suit. My boy is quite a bit more of a leader than a follower like his sister is though so maybe he won't. When I see these children with signs like this it really does disgust me. Why can't we just let kids be kids? Yeah they might pick up on it growing up, but to encourage it just plain seems wrong to me. I couldn't imagine using my child for political propaganda. Theyre my kid for goodness sakes. I've never tried to teach my kids my politics at all. I've just always told them that no matter what you treat people with respect until they give you a reason not to. And that more than likely needs to be a personal reason. Not just because you don't agree with them on something. My 17 year old is in liberal mode right now and it scares me knowing she will be going to a university next year and it will most likely just intensify, but it's her life to live and she knows my political views now at this point. I can only guide her and let her live for herself and her experiences, but always be there to offer advice when she needs it. Tldr I just really don't understand any of this, how a parent can do this to their kids. It really hurts my heart. One of the worst things a child can experience is their parent breaking down in any way, shape, or form.I went to public school, so I knew all the good cuss words by this kid’s age but if I had ever dared to even write the word “fuck” and my parents saw it they would have beat the cheeks off my ass in an instant.

Probably explained as something like "group of bad people that want to give guns to other bad people so they can shoot whoever they want"Probably explained as something like "group of bad people that want to give guns to other bad people so they can shoot whoever they want"Just like hitler had child soldiers and Muslims have kids with grenades to get close to soldiers. Say whatever you want to but don’t mistreat and brainwash your damn kids. That’s a form of abuse right there. Of course. The left hate children and see them only as easily brainwashed servants. This is exactly how Chyna's "great leap forward" happened. They use the kids to kill their parents, teachers, and other "authoritative" figures by reporting them to Mao because they got brainwashed. Then afterwards, the "revolutionary" kiddies were lined up against the wall and shot.Also, we should blur kids faces. His parents are getting him to do this. You think in 15 years he will be proud of this? When I was a kid my parents would ground me for using the word fuck let alone carrying around a sign with fuck on it. This is the disease of liberalism. The kids pay the price."I dont know how my country was founded, or how to tie my shoes correctly, but FUCK THE NRA, mom can i have the money you promised me now? i wana go home this protest is super gay" I remember a time when the Westboro Baptist Church was condemned, among many other reasons, for bringing their children to the protests. I’m sure this little guy will be on hormone therapy to transition to a little girl in the next two years with parents like that.As a ladypede, and a mother to be, I won't directly sway my children in politics. I want them to have their innocence. I want them to enjoy being a kid. When they get their first job, I'll probably be a bit more upfront about issues and explaining this crazy world, but at 8, they won't be holding any political sign. The left is pretty bad about this. Very young children are made to march, hold signs, wear shirts and repeat dogmas that they aren't able to fully comprehend. I don't see many examples of it on the right side, but I don't want to be that heavy handed with my beliefs either. That's not to say that I wouldn't explain concepts as they come up in daily conversation, like religion, and why most kids in class don't have a daddy (oof), etc, but I'm not going to brow beat my children with my viewpoints. 
Pics like this always stir up these feelings. And with all these stupid marches lately I guess I just needed to get it off my chest. Lol ok bye /rant You are a good mom! Your kids are lucky! Stay vigilant especially when they go to high school. They are hit with a lot of liberal views not taught at home! Keep em grounded in truth and they will become great adults and leaders!! You are a good mom! Your kids are lucky! Stay vigilant especially when they go to high school. They are hit with a lot of liberal views not taught at home! Keep em grounded in truth and they will become great adults and leaders!! Dems have adopted the Palestinian model. The Palestinians pioneered the exploitation of their own children, to the point of allowing them to die, purely for the PR valueWhile some of the kids have gone through a traumatic experience, the hard truth is that still doesn't make them qualified to lecture us on guns or the Consitution. They simply don't have the real world expirence or knowledge of firearms to do so.Notice how they always have an iPhone recording it so they can upload it to Facebook and virtual signal to their SoyBoy friends. And pornstars as well, oh, oh, and actors who spend their whole lives pretending to be people they are not. And when their kids grow up and murder them, the family is like ...what happened? Why was little johnny so angry? Back in my day, i mean hell, even today, we watch what we say around children because we are responsible adults. Liberals are degenerates. These people are so Godless that they encourage their children to curse to make some kind of political statement. Anyone who uses their kids to further their agenda is a piece of human trash. Doesn't matter what the opinion is.Well that seems like a group we should consider our equals with whom we should negotiate our God given rights & allow to control everything. Education, culture/Hollywood/media, every college campus, circut judges & both political parties are controlled & filled with or by insane leftists. Our own kids are sent to public schools with these people & "educated" by a recent college graduate who consumes the left wing media in all its incarnations. WE NEED TO FIX PUBLIC EDUCATION OR WE'RE DOOMED!No kid, fuck those politicians who made the gun free zones. That’s exactly where the shit shows take place. I absolutely hate this shit. FOR ANY CAUSE. Unlike a lot of people here I'm someone that doesn't really have a side in anything, I just want people to do the right thing (the good thing) and for people to be nice. And I have no problem calling out shit. I wrote this on one where kids were for guns, and I'll copy and paste it here.  "Honestly, even if they're in the right, if the parents put them up to this, they're shitty parents. Kids shouldn't be puppets. If the kids did it themselves good on them, but at the same time, we just had a conversation about kids not having fully developed brains, and that they shouldn't be allowed to vote and their say doesn't mean much (see: when those kids were talking about gun laws and how guns are bad)--now because they're saying something this subreddit likes, it's like wooo ya go kids. Let kids be kids. Let them take in information, and think for themselves, but let kids be kids. These little bros should be playing video games, or chatting up girls, or playing sports. Not this." Using your kids to move your own cause, is shitty af. I hate all the people that do it.Someone just needs to tell that kid that once their cunthole parents no longer dictate shit, he too will have the opportunity to own these amazing toys! Yet, there are no pro 2A marches. If the left can teach and use their kids to push their agenda why is the right not doing the same? Is the NRA planning a counter march sometime soon? Fight fire with fire I say. Why are their no pro 2A children crying and begging for their right not to be taken away. I'm not American so forgive me if this is an overreaction. I doubt these kids even know who the NRA are or what they stand for. To them, it's just another scary buzzword used by their parents So that's what parents and teachers are promoting these days. No wonder the kids have turned to eating Tide Pods. Nazi Soros and nazi islamic terrorist supporter Louis Farrakhan are behind these anti Second Amendment marches. It was the Antifa revolution they had planned for last November 4th, but they had postponed. It was backed by nazi Soros, Hollyweird hypocrites and crazy nazis all over the world, fluffed by Hillary Clinton, Obama and the deep state. They even had marchers globally.... asking for the USA to disarm? Really stupid. They are the new Nazi Youth. Very lame. Will guarantee a red wave this November.

I hope you had fun getting off to your downvotes... never understood that but have fun budI’d love to know where the shot placement was for the guy in the black. Looks like he took two good ones, the last being point blank.Looks like first two shots were at blue then point blank at black.

Most can become proficient with an individual weapon in just one trip to the range (provided they brought enough ammo.)I have no idea, maybe we should request a real firearms instructor AMA. I think it varies a lot from person to person, I've heard Annie Oakley was pretty much a dead shot right from the start. My oldest daughter is the best shot in the family and I've got like 20 years of shooting experience on her, until certain recent developments I had some pretty high hopes of getting her through college on a three-gun scholarship, but I'm not sure many colleges are going to have shooting teams by then.

That's what you practice for.Oh, ha ha, the point and click interface is an old joke. But seriously, most people can be proficient after a couple hundred rounds. If you haven't figured it out by then, you either have a wonkey trigger or you need to consider the possibility that CCW is not for you.Shooting at the range and shooting at people are 2 very different things.  Most people get shaky when the adrenaline is pumping.  Being accurate with a handgun is not nearly as easy as most people think it is.

Mines is real. Ded laughing. Good video. I also think the guard exercised bad judgement when he jumped over the counter. Now granted, one of those crooks would have been crazy to mess with him because if he had to fire again it probably would have been a kill shot. But the guard lacked caution in a few places where that should have been a priority.he knew it too.   if they tried anything he would give em the ol' pistol whip.  homies got owned LOL. Not to mention he waited a bit for those shots to take some effect before jumping in. Blue guy was out for the count once the blood came out a decent bit on his arm. Good video.

Sucks you don’t have the original. Guy in the blue sweat shirt is like did you shoot me! And the good guy with the gun. Says he’ll yeah I shot you your gun might be fake but mine is real! http://ktla.com/2018/01/18/mines-real-viral-video-show-private-security-guard-shooting-2-would-be-robbers-1-with-fake-weapon-in-gardena/I wonder if he meant to shoot him there it was a good shot. Right in the arm he was holding the gun with, legit. Possible he was so focused on the gun in the kids hand his shots went that way.  Sort of target fixation.  Like he did it but not reeeally on purpose?Possible he was so focused on the gun in the kids hand his shots went that way.  Sort of target fixation.  Like he did it but not reeeally on purpose?That security guard was a stick up man before being hired I'd bet. Maybe that's what we need though. They're trained in that shit!Only thing he did wrong was not kill those mother fuckers...they’ll be out on the street doing it again after their prison time When I made my original comment I hadn’t heard the sound and didn’t know he actually shot them. I thought he was just waiving his gun around and then trying subdue them. If he’s done that without shooting them, they really could have jumped him.

My new goal in life is to meet this guy, shake his hand, and buy him a beerThis is the same woman who got arrested, i think for some kind of fraud in florida. She drew attention to herself with the "fuck trump" sticker on her truck. Someone posted on here a while back.You’re right it’s the same woman, but it was in Texas sadly outside of Houston. There were a ton of complaints and then the ACLU got involved and blah blah blah, she’s disgusting. You’re right it’s the same woman, but it was in Texas sadly outside of Houston. There were a ton of complaints and then the ACLU got involved and blah blah blah, she’s disgusting. That's the thing about these protests, and about political debate (and even non-political debate) in general. If you have a brain in your head, you don't bother trying to sway the other side. You try to sway the people watching. This sign, and the idiots who created it, are there solely for the benefit of their fellow protesters. There isn't a single person looking at that sign who's thinking, "Well, I can see both sides of the gun debate...but 'FUCK TRUMP' is a game-clinching three from behind the arc. Great point. I hate guns now." (Also, exactly what did Trump have to do with the shooting? I guess sometime in his 13 months in office before the Stoneman Douglas shooting he should've ordered the Republican Congress to craft a bill banning AR-15s, then signed it. Something Obama never thought to do in 96 months.) Obviously these people are losers... fat and stupid with nothing better to do. Evidently, the only way they can feel they have some value or social currency is by railing against half the country. They feel great about doing so because they have been informed by the establishment that it is they are on the "right" side of the Trump issue. These gullible fools will never do more research than watching an episode of the daily show with Trevor Notalent.Oh yeah. Def gonna hand over my guns to these people lmao these assholes are high. Fuck em. Let’s see them come take our guns. My right trigger finger has been itchy ever since I got out of the Marines. They're definitely beneficiaries of SNAP & EBT/food stamps. I'd bet my life those fat bodies have been filled with govt cheese since their unintended births. no,  Fuck leftists forever.  never hire them, never do business with them, never patronize their businesses, cut them off, cute them out of our society.  forever.  they are cancer... fascists... hate filled monsters.They think their going to win midterms hahahahahaha i know me and every one i know our going to fight these ignorant liberals agenda by voting for maga canadiates me, and my family and friendsA quick guide for interpreting the middle finger: knuckles forward is a boss; knuckles back is a bitch. Meh, just a red blooded American Capitalist making money off of fools by making them think they are "edgy." I celebrate it!When they have to start cleaning up all that shit they threw all over the place, they’re gonna be using straws and I’d love to be there to say “missed a spot”. We aren't winning unless there are losers. Losers aren't really losing unless they are so completely and utterly defeated they take to the streets and remind us they are losing and want to keep on losing.Two ugly hearted people trying to make me believe they actually care about others. Seriously. This is who they've sent. Any people are unsure why nobody wants to be outted as a Trump supporter to the masses. I dare anyone to wear a MAGA hat and walk around a liberal city. Bullies.  This hateful bullying that the left breeds and encourages is exactly why these mass shootings are occurring.  They can't help but be hateful towards their neighbors for anything they disagree on.  And when you're on the left and the people who you thought were your friends on the left inevitably turn against you and bully you, there's nowhere else to go... so they lash out.Ruthless and Crude! Our government is a democracy. You lost, you losers!! Leave, if you need to. We put up with Obozo crap for 8 yrs- Benghazi, bergdahl, Solyndra, JV ISIS, Pallets of money flown to Iran in dead of night, Corruption of IRS, VA, DOJ, FBI & cash for clunkers!We cried, but we took it!! Call the waaambulance!! Cause these losers are used to getting participation trophies. Hillary lost and w/ her she took Obama’s legacy and Soros plans to dominate our great country! God blessed America on Nov 8!! That's why revolvers were invented.

It's supposed to be a youtube alternative that works torrent style. Styxhexenhammer666 is probably the most notable user on the platform (or at least the only one I've heard of.)Happen to know when that video was taken? Specifically I'm wondering if it was before or after the Florida shooting. He is, he is a senior at Parkland still. He just gets to ditch school to go be a puppet for the media. The kid went through a lot but that's no excuse for some of the truely disgusting things he says. I blame the media for inflating his ego, giving him a platform, and most likely feeding him talking points. I believe he thinks he doing the right thing, I feel bad for him honestly. His heart is probably in the right place, his ideas are fucked though. With that in mind I try not to judge him to hard but he really just needs to go away.He's a senior in a 3000 student school with dozens of buildings, and the shooting happened in freshman building to freshmen. He wasn't in the building, he wasn't affected, but he's first to grab spotlight for himself to launch his political career of repealing human rights.Don't forget the person, my friend. They are misguided sure, but we can't forget that they are people just like us.This kid may be wrong about almost everything he says, but he did go through a lot. I went to a big high school with around 3k students also, and that shit would have been traumatizing for sure. I understand that, but it's clear as fuck what this dude is doing. He didn't go through a lot. He did go through a little bit and then decided to use it for his career.He did go through a lot. This is a kid, an emotionally unstable person who just went through a super traumatic experience where people he probably saw everyday (yes everyday. A 3k student school really isn't as big as you would think) were slaughtered by a retard who slipped through the cracks of involuntary commitment, due to negligence. Imagine being this kid. He was probably already liberal. Then this shit goes down and he has a hard time processing it, and goes with his knee jerk reaction; Gun laws. Then the vultures that are CNN pick this kid up and make him a national celebrity. This kid is being used and manipulated. You're the type of idiots who make us look bad to the rest of Reddit.

There is literally an angry mob marching on the national mall demanding the government revoke the right to bear arms and calling for revolution while throwing up communist salutes. Think about how much money was wasted just to have it blow up in their faces  because their Katniss went full Commie Salute! They should remove the right to bear arms, but only to those who ask to remove the right to bear arms.yeesh , even the old school communists like Che , Orwell, Lenin , knew you CANNOT HAVE A REVOLUTION WITHOUT THE ARMED CITIZENSit felt more Saturday Night Fever or Borat to me, with the whole chest puff and the step back move... but yeah I see your point.Haha yeah, wtf was that? I think thats what makes people think nazi, its almost like he was clicking his heels, he prob did, freakin weirdo.  And this is why we have the 2nd amendment. They want our guns they'll have to rip it from our cold dead hands. Yeah, and Idk about you, but I'm willing to bet that I have more bullets then they have people willing to try and take my gun from me.You don't think they want to outlaw private ownership and confiscate weapons? You haven't been paying attention.Regarding the weapons, Liberals do, Communists don't. Communists want guns for everyone in order to be able to revolt and then take away property rights. They keep pushing for legal guns in Europe for example.and then once the glorious revolution is over, take the guns and fire up the gulags. or was that not real communism? Well yeah. That's how that works. Hope you didn't think I thought otherwise from my previous comment, 'pede.And here I thought this sub would be better than this. Fucking normie cuckservatives can't even get their salutes right. REEEEEEE.So far I've seen two posts today where the town retards confuse the Roman salute with the Raised fist and it triggers the fuck out of me, tbqh.

I am a gun owner and a die hard second amendment supporter. But it's time to ban semi-automatics, fully semi-automatics, full auto-semis, semi fulls, ammunition, assault guns with too many magazine clips, shoulder things that go up, and guns designed to kill people. That's just common sense. After that you can have all the guns you want! After a thorough psychological evaluation, of course. And you can even go down to the local precinct to visit your gun under strict supervision whenever you want if you have a valid reason.
Don't get me wrong. I'm all about the second amendment. The right to bear arms is extremely important to me, but isn't time we abolish the second amendment? Isn't it a little outdated? Well regulated militia. Why does anyone even need a gun?
I'm not saying we ban guns. Fucking Christ you gun obsessed psychopaths, get a grip. Calm down, no one is coming for your guns. No one is saying ban all guns. I'm just saying that we ban the guns that can kill people. No one, and Listen, I repeat no one has ever suggested that we ban guns or abolish the secondment amendment. I don't even know where you evil baby killing monsters come up with that one.
No one is a bigger supporter of gun rights than me. Common sense. Why won't you compromise?Listen, I grew up around guns. I am a gun owner and a die hard second amendment supporter.

Don't get me wrong. I'm all about the second amendment. The right to bear arms is extremely important to me, but isn't time we abolish the second amendment? Isn't it a little outdated? Well regulated militia. Why does anyone even need a gun?
I'm not saying we ban guns. Fucking Christ you gun obsessed psychopaths, get a grip. Calm down, no one is coming for your guns. No one is saying ban all guns. I'm just saying that we ban the guns that can kill people. No one, and Listen, I repeat no one has ever suggested that we ban guns or abolish the secondment amendment. I don't even know where you evil baby killing monsters come up with that one.
No one is a bigger supporter of gun rights than me. Common sense. Why won't you compromise?I don't like what you insinuating here. His politics suck. He's ignorant and arrogant. His ignorance and arrogance are being co-opt by a corrupt mainstream media and the whole situation is despicable. But what I think you're insinuating crosses a line and I think that type of rhetoric should be beneath this community.  I think he meant he's surprised people are still listening to this dork. Or maybe that his15 min of fame should be about up by now.Honestly it could go either way. I just try to keep a positive spin on things until proven otherwise. No one wants him to see any harm. Mostly I just want the media to stop propping him up. Jesus, he still needs to finish high school and has said he wants to quit school and be a full time activist.I hope he returns to education and gets a job doing something productive for society. It's sad to see him held up by puppet strings by community organizers.He's being controlled by other interests funding this shit. He's a kid who still has time to learn. If he was an adult doing this I'd feel differently, but he's not even fully grown. His brain has room to develop, and it's being filled with bullshit from activist folk. I want him to get out of the spotlight and learn to think for himself and do something productive.No, I’m just wondering why he’s still prominent in all of the news. It makes me ask more questions about who’s behind all of this stuff.  Now democrats want him to be President??? I mean this is truly getting ridiculous....then you add in his hitler salute at the end...I’m
Just appalled by this guy.The Hitler comparison is kind of cringe to be honest, as he is pretty much in direct contrast to him.I thought it was the leftist shtick to call everyone they don't like a Nazi. Let's not do the same, especially when it's not even comparable. Communists were bad enough, and he certainly fits that bill.The Hitler comparison is kind of cringe to be honest, as he is pretty much in direct contrast to him.I thought it was the leftist shtick to call everyone they don't like a Nazi.

Retired FBI dad worked for lazy corrupt FBI organization that allowed this to happen. Member when Obama literally wanted to create a Hitler Youth/SS equivalent for liberalism while campaigning in 2008? I member.Yes I also remember. And he did it. It just didn't come together in the way he first presented the concept to the public. Speaking of which, it seems all recordings of his original Obama Youth adverts have been deleted from YT.He had ads for this Obama Youth on cable television. I remember him referring to it as the civilian equivalent of the military. It was a bunch of kids dressed up in red uniforms.George Soros is throwing all his money into Generation Z-- seeing as they've been shown to be more conservative than millennials. They're obviously hoping to sway the next election since all the millions of illegals weren't sufficient."Open" as in dissolving nations into international bodies for globalist rule of the world from one single central government..."Open" as in dissolving nations into international bodies for globalist rule of the world from one single central government..."Open" as in dissolving nations into international bodies for globalist rule of the world from one single central government...Mildly uniformed regular joe here who likes his guns. Just read through what this kid would like to see happen..A digitization of ATF records. Ok, sounds reasonable enough. Helps law enforcement keep guns out of the hands of psychos, right? A universal background check to close to Gun Show loophole. Not entirely sure what that loophole is, or how a “universal background check” is any different, or if it’s the same, as a regular background check when purchasing a gun. From what little bit I read, he’s suggesting keeping 18 year olds from buying weapons. Is he suggesting we raise the limit to 21 across the board? This is where he’s starting to lose me. If you’re an 18 year old tax-paying legal adult who passes background checks, why can you not exercise your right to defend yourself? Edit: I really, really love this sub. There are times I don’t agree with everything posted, but I get nothing but engaging conversation here. Lurked for about a year and just recently started commenting. Fuck the stigma Reddit puts on this sub. Plus I’m not met with a goddamn 10 minute timer every time I want to continue having a conversation.. We spend too much time preparing kids for perpetual schooling, and not enough time on how to be an adult. Couple that with absentee dads, perpetual wineo soccer moms, and kids that only play video games all day learning more how to shit-talk and less how to compromise, we’ll here you have it.I still don’t get the assault rifle thing. An AR 15 is just a semi-auto rifle, just like an M1A. It’s cheaper I guess, but the difference between getting an M1A which is much more powerful, vs an AR 15 is just a couple more months of dishwashing and saving.I hate to say it but it's only a matter of time until this stuff becomes reality. They're indoctrinating the next generation of voters with this stuff and it'll probably happen in the next 10-20 years. that's what they want you to believe. That's the same line of bullshit they have been saying that we would never have another republican president. The map and country was going left. Don't buy into their bullshit. It's not who can shout loudest but who get's out and votes.If a traditional Republican had run against Clinton then she would be president and the map would probably be died blue. Don't think that Democrats are losing. They're not. They fooled the majority in the country into this Russia bullshit, covered their asses after all of their shady primary shit, and made it through everyone knowing about their emails. They're not too be underestimated. We are gonna be fighting in the streets, hopefully(if it is going to come to pass) before my boys are Draft age.it's instructive to look up the AMA for people who lived through the LA riots in '92.  A few were related to the rooftop Koreans.  They specifically said that for a riot situation, where there is a mob of people headed to your house or store, and you're on the roof....a handgun is not gonna cut it. you need high capacity, long range shooting power. Had an argument online with a guy that wanted to ban assault weapons and that civilians shouldn’t have access to military weapons. We asked him about a 92fs, m9, m91/30, m1911, Remington 870, m1, Colt 1901. He came back with a typical response of “that’s not what I meant” and “I can’t define one but I know one when I see it”.“High capacity magazine” If you don’t shoot guns how do you know what’s high capacity. 30rd mags are the most common. People buy them because they’re the most common.I’ve asked multiple people that want stricter background checks, what they think current background checks cover. Also if they know the process for buying a gun. I have yet to get an answer from them.That’s most likely part of it, but I also think they have no idea how of how you actually go about purchasing a gun or what the restrictions are for purchasing one.He needs to be suggesting voting age be repeal back to 21...because no way are you mature enough to vote and not handle a fire arm.So, as long as you don't come in here calling everyone racist nazi cis-shit baby killers, who support an orange rapist sexist whatever, people are pretty chill.People come in here posting inflammatory shit, for the sole purpose of getting banned, so they can run back to whatever shithole sub they get the most attention from and use it as oppression points.Gun show loophole is a myth that doesn't exist. They are still required to run background checks and you are not allowed to do anything there that you cannot do at your local arms dealer.

It's vaguely reminiscent of the John Travolta dance move in "Saturday Night Fever", but in, like, a really not cool way. : / That's exactly what I saw too. I'm convinced his hip pops out a little bit for extra flair, behind that podium. "White Rose survivor Jürgen Wittenstein described what it was like for ordinary Germans to live in Nazi Germany:"The government – or rather, the party – controlled everything: the news media, arms, police, the armed forces, the judiciary system, communications, travel, all levels of education from kindergarten to universities, all cultural and religious institutions. Political indoctrination started at a very early age, and continued by means of the Hitler Youth with the ultimate goal of complete mind control. Children were exhorted in school to denounce even their own parents for derogatory remarks about Hitler or Nazi ideology."Hitler actually loosened gun control laws after he rose to power. With the exception of German Jews, of course, but that’s a different subject. There’s nothing in fascist ideology that makes it anti-gun.On the other hand, the idea of a revolution aimed at tearing everything established down and supplanting it with an egalitarian utopia is very much a feature of communism.This is COMMUNISM we’re dealing with here, folks. We need to get on message and be educated about politics and history.Hitler loosened gun laws for people he knew would follow his orders and obey his every whim. He took guns away from the targeted classes that were a threat to his world order - the Jews, the Roma, etc -- these people were soon sent to the gas chambers. They were disarmed first, of course, to make their annihilation easier.Fascism IS authoritarian. There's nothing good about it, nor was it about the preservation of culture -- that was the lie to make it sound good. It was perverse, evil, ugly, violent, and stupid. It's not the opposite of communism, it's merely another aspect of it. Communism was International Socialism. Fascism is National Socialism. It doesn't matter the name or the color of their uniforms: millions of innocent people died as a result of it. Bury it and move on.Your entire post is based on a huge lie pushed by progressives ever since the Nazis fell and the American Progressive Left had to distance itself from the monster it inspired.

What he doesn't realize is the silent majority knows he's a beta cuck and cringes at his 2.5 inch arms.he is of the protected Chosen class, he’ll be fine. he’ll be hired and given a job somewhere to keep him quiet once his usefulness depletesBlood!

It's the first step to socalist tyranny. The issue this rally wants to solve is the populace’s ability to defend itself. It isn’t about schools or bump stocks or scary black rifles. It is about removing the one and only thing that keeps us free from our already horrendous government. You have to view their motives correctly, then you understand. It's the first step to socalist tyranny. I know that he is just a kid, and he's being used and he's too stupid  to look past "oooh look how popular I am" to actually see that he's being used. BUT I would like to throat punch him.I was at the gym today and the rally was on one of the tvs. I didn't have the headphones tuned to the station so I didn't hear any of it. But from the optics it looked really, really auhtoritarian. The body language of the speakers was like Mussolini or from some dystopian movie.All of this because the Broward County SD refused to reel in the easiest fish that you could catch.  ...Just like Hitler. I think he's studying the Nazi's or is being rehearsed by someone whos stidied the Nazi's to imitate their posturing.I love how communism is "power to the people" while the government fucks the people over, controls what they can and cannot do, and murders those who disagree. Communism is for the people just as much as a donkey is for bacon. Communism sounds utopian so that the elites of the movement can gain gullible followers and then stab them in the fucking back once they're put in power.Communism sounds like it should work ideally, the only issue is natural human nature to want to rule over things; hence why it has no chance in hell of ever being a system that works.  People are naturally greedy is all.  Even in its most benevolent it still ends up devolving into Mao/Stalin eventually.First thing I noted too.

Ostensibly it helps eliminate earmarks, which is definitely a good thing since earmarks are in essence an inefficient subsidy of an industry or region at the expense of the country.Anytime someone uses "making us all look bad", you can tell they're being a shill and a liar and anything but a leader. A leader leads by example, they don't need to play the "who's with me!??!" coward card.Some of us are intelligent enough to "roll our eyes a bit" at some of the ramblings of Alex Jones, while still being intelligent enough to know that the core of his beliefs are absolutely true and continue to be proven true time and time again.Other than the global elite practicing bizarre occult rituals, the general globalism + marxist/communists + tech left + radical islam vs patriots battle ongoing right now i'd say is spot on. Alex Jones most days just comments on mainstream news articles. He's not putting out "interdimensional vampire" theories everyday.I just watched that video then the hour and a half long video of bohemian grove by Alex Jones. Damn. We have some sick and evil people at the top of our govt. nothing that goes on behind these closed door meetings with all of these secret societies can be good. Salvation isn’t found in secrecy. It’s found in Jesus Christ.Glad I could inform you! Sorry if I fucked up your worldview ;) The truth really is stranger than fiction, and there are alot of evil fucks running our society. Scary to think about, but think about it we must.My dude.  Do some of you’re own research. While i can roll my eyes at many of the things he’s said , he’s proven himself time and time again with many major facts that no one else would report on.

Coast who can’t afford houses due to the rising cost of “living” (paying for illegals)?Lol wtf? I'm not poor I just can't afford the ridiculous housing costs on the west coast due to mass migration from the south... 15 yrs ago I would have a McMansion in the area I live in bit there's too many libtard tech fucks moving here from San Francisco...

Not even close. This kid is gonna be so disappointed when he's not even listed as a footnote in the annals of history.  I mean, don't get me wrong, when I was 17 I was pretty full of myself.  This is just a whole other level of delusion.  I almost feel bad for the kid.  I'm still not convinced he's not on our side.  There's no WAY someone could be this oblivious, right?  There's no way someone could be this much of a tool...I mean this has to be to make their whole movement look dumb, right? When the fuck did this high school child become a national leader on gun control, and why should we care. He is a kid being groomed by CNN forget his name and move onIf it's any consolation, considering his armband blunder and how he gets on everyone's nerves, the left won't use the little puppet boy for much longer. And considering he's getting rejected by every college worth a damn, soon the only thing he will have to say to you is "would you like fries with that?"Is it bad that a part of me kind of wants them to actually make a legitiment push to confiscate guns? I sort of crave the feeling of banding together with a group of pedes and with them, saying to their faces, "over our COLD. DEAD. fucking hands you goddamn MOTHERFUCKING SONS OF BITCHESWe are all ready for it. Ill fight to my last breath. They wont take our independence. This isnt about guns. Its NWO, its abolishing America: the last bastion of freedom. Thats all this is.Its like if Hitler and Mr Mackey had a love-child.    All the fascism, but with a giant head and tiny body.   They don't even have the most basic idea of what being an adult entails.  David looks like his balls havent dropped yet.How funny is it that they're not going to manage to accomplish a damn thing with this, just like the women's marches?Couldn't the leftist fascist media have chosen a less cringe-worthy guy as the face of their movement? smh his vice-fascist is some bald tranny tooOur guns are a deterrent to those who want to impose tyranny, both domestic and abroad. Try to take them, and watch what happens. This boy is getting too big for his britches. I hate that he had to experience that shooting but the kid probably just recently figured out how his dick works and they're listening to him about gun laws? Sit down and stop using the blood of your fellow class mates as fuel for your agenda. There is a war coming I'm afraid. it won't be a matter of months but a matter of years. These soft kids being brainwashed by their teachers and the msm will soon be running for office and the fading left will support them giving new life to themselves. Putting radical leftists in power against a very conservative public. I hope I'm wrong.What a sad day to see students who supposedly took civics fighting to take away the rights our founders fought so hard for them to have.He's such a fag! That kid would have been stuffed into his locker just a few years ago before we started allowing the pussies from glee club to dictate what's cool. Why are liberals even listening to a sheltered wealthy white male? Aren't they evil? Never too young to learn about government incompetence.

It's fucking 2018. It's about time to let someone else have all the rights.They got lucky right after Columbine my school banned backpacks, long coats, and any black clothing, altogether.Fidel never sent the gays to work camps for life on the suggestion of Che.

There is no reason, emotional or logical, to support a murderous criminal's regime.

Many of them may be evil, but let's be careful not to dehumanize them like they dehumanize us.As a nice human being, I'm naturally inclined to agree with you, but look where being respectful and tolerant of the left has gotten us. They control the government, the media, colleges, 95% of major corporations. They've used our kindness and "always too busy working and raising families to get involved" attitude to bring our once great nation to its knees in only about 50-60 years.

Any other kind of thinking leads to senseless violence and atrocities. Stay smart. Don't lose your head.A child. You are all attacking children that are afraid of Christian White Nationalists with assault rifles. Humanity at some point must outweigh white fearA Polish mercenary was once asked how it felt to take another human life, his response was "I wouldn't know, i've only killed Communists"Need to fight fire with fire. We're the ones with logic, reason, and statistics on our side. Why should we let them get away with dehumanizing us without giving them a dose of their own medicine.Hell, yeah. Tired of pretending to be civil with braindead marxist cultists and masochistic pussies. They're worthless traitors and not worthy of discourse. It's wrong because you lose all logic and reason. That's why they are the way they are. It's also how atrocities get started.Pretty fucked for anyone to thing he was a good man. He executed gays by the dozen. Just lined them up and shot them.The unshowered hippies and granola heads (Think Portland Oregan and white people with dreadlocks who take psychedelics) have been wearing Che shirts at music festivals for years now.

Any other kind of thinking leads to senseless violence and atrocities. Stay smart. Don't lose your head.A child. You are all attacking children that are afraid of Christian White Nationalists with assault rifles. Humanity at some point must outweigh white fearA Polish mercenary was once asked how it felt to take another human life, his response was "I wouldn't know, i've only killed Communists"Need to fight fire with fire. We're the ones with logic, reason, and statistics on our side. Why should we let them get away with dehumanizing us without giving them a dose of their own medicine.Hell, yeah. Tired of pretending to be civil with braindead marxist cultists and masochistic pussies. They're worthless traitors and not worthy of discourse. It's wrong because you lose all logic and reason. That's why they are the way they are. It's also how atrocities get started.Liberals base their decisions on emotion, not logic. This is due to their lack of critical thinking skills. Hence why their movements are run by women and low T boys. "March for Our Lives", "Black Lives Matter", "Net Neutrality", "Patriot Act" - each strategically crafted to appear like something they're not. They sound great to the uninformed, but anyone that opposes them looks like an asshole.In this case, they are basing their ideology solely on what the deep state tells them to. There is no reason, emotional or logical, to support a murderous criminal's regime. Emotional reasons include: envy (of people with more money and/or envy of another country's system that you perceive as superior), misdirected compassion (for perceived victims), spite (for perceived perpetrators), ambition (they would like to be a ruling class member of such a regime), greed (they covet stuff that isn't theirs), and/or malice (the person is just a vile piece of shit).Logical reasons include: I want to start a worker's revolution and kill anyone who tries to stop it, just like they did in that other country, because 1) I want to start a worker's revolution 2) I would like an excuse to murder people 3) I want to make people suffer 4) I concluded that the collateral damage required to achieve what they did in that other country was worth it 5) I find the death and misery that other country caused to be admirable and I would like to emulate it in my country.Liberals base their decisions on emotion, not logic.

Many of them may be evil, but let's be careful not to dehumanize them like they dehumanize us.As a nice human being, I'm naturally inclined to agree with you, but look where being respectful and tolerant of the left has gotten us.

Fuck these morons.Pretty fucked for anyone to thing he was a good man. He executed gays by the dozen. Just lined them up and shot them.The unshowered hippies and granola heads (Think Portland Oregan and white people with dreadlocks who take psychedelics) have been wearing Che shirts at music festivals for years now. It's become their counter culture. They are idiots.The unshowered hippies and granola heads (Think Portland Oregan and white people with dreadlocks who take psychedelics) have been wearing Che shirts at music festivals for years now.

I guess the Leftists don't mind that since they're already bowing to Islam.Very probably, but the famous quote about "Negroes" being "indolent and lazy, and spends his money on frivolities" is a Che quote from what I remember. The Left’s only principle seems to be an animosity towards White people and the societies they/we have traditionally built.Very probably, but the famous quote about "Negroes" being "indolent and lazy, and spends his money on frivolities" is a Che quote from what I remember.

She will always be an angry lesbian. These kids can try to pretend they’re a non partisan, grassroots movement, but they were destined to be a mouthpiece for the left. They want to be a mouthpiece for the left. These people never grow out of their commie leftists phase. She will be running  a "non-profit" for leftist causes and will use her past "fame" to push for more bullshit.She is actually doing her cause harm.

Most importantly, they always think other countries as better than the U.S. and want to ruin our country to make it more like others.Yeah like if you cannot bare the freedom in the US why don’t you just go back to your beloved motherland? It’s unfair to migrate to US where you have every luxury you ever dreamed of unlike your crappy country and complain about some traditions that you don’t agree with while enjoying all the benefits that US offers. Like no one even asked you to come in the first place lol I dare her to go on marches like this in her own country with this much bravery without getting shot or something The thing people don't seem to realize about this country is that it's an experiment. This country doesn't exist to provide for the common good of its people, it's supposed to exist as a haven of near-total liberty. If people want to live somewhere without guaranteed freedoms they can move to literally any other country on Earth rather than ruining the purpose of this one.Yeah like if you cannot bare the freedom in the US why don’t you just go back to your beloved motherland?

That's gonna be a real bummer for their egos...They are literally drama students.  Of course they're happy about it.  You can see the shitty high school theater coaching in everything they do.  They are literally drama students.  Of course they're happy about it.  You can see the shitty high school theater coaching in everything they do.  Why are we openly promoting communism now in America? How the heck has communism come back as a threat? But THIS time, it's being PROMOTED BY THE ESTABLISHMENT and masquerading as some sort of anti-establishment protest just so idiot Millennials and dumb high school kids will take to it. Watch Yuri Bezmenov, defected KGB agent (killed by Soviets), for exposing the truth of soviet subversion, cultural Marxism, feminism, etc. It's on YouTube. This was all by design and after the USSR fell a lot of people still carried it forward, media included. What happened is that we let it happen. Is was so incremental that we didn’t realize it was taking over. We have a chance to stop it, and we can’t back down. This shit happened in the 60s, but the people had some balls left so most of the loony ones actually got jobs, got married, had kids and led productive lives. The ones like Bill Ayers never made that leap. And the Soviets and Communists were so far infiltrated into our country even at that point they stole the nuclear bomb technology.So was Patton. He should've been allowed to steamroll right to Moscow and personally put a bullet in Stalin's head from that Colt Peacemaker of his.The realization of the communist long term plan to infiltrate academia is happening. It only took them 40ish years, but apparently it worked.They started back in the beginning of the 20th century. We let The Frankfurt School move from Germany to NYC in 1935 and let it become part of Columbia University.Holy shit! I had a older co-worker who went to Columbia. He worked in finance and was quite smart. He quit a while ago and this last election I was looking up people I knew on the federal election commission donation list and he came up on the list as a Bernie donor. Blew my mind. I'm still shocked. You mentioning this now is fuxking scary. There were people riding their bike earlier today with a poster taped on front saying "California Trump's Trump". There is some sick shit going on right now. I don't know how to explain this but I think we've already lost the ideological subversion game. Establishment consolidation of power is complete, Trump was an error and they're screwing him every waking moment. They need us normal folks to know we truly have no power. The attack on our gun rights is the last major step to conquering America without firing a single shot. God help us.And US media will continue to promote her. It's okay to idolize actual violent dictators today, apparently. Our lives under capitalism and true freedom in the relatively free western world are so boring and prosperous, that communism is romanticized. Because there is a large % of our population that doesn't want to work hard to make a living and communism is the supposed answer to their problem.Elite preparing the population for when the mother of all financial crisis explode. Divide and conquerI mean let her wear whatever she wants, the problem is that there are people who take someone like her seriously. ... like most of the dopes educated in public schools.  Public education needs to be done away with it in its current form.Maybe, man. Im not smart enough to tell you how it should be done. Im not even sure if it can be done. There will always be morons like her in this worldWell you can think whatever the fuck you want but she still has the freedom to wear whatever retarded sht she wants to, the fact that shes a fucking moron and a stooge doesnt change that.Nothing wrong with that. I’m Cuban and there’s nothing wrong with being proud of your heritage. I hate the Castros, and communism, and everything they stand for. Doesn’t mean I have to hate the country. It’s a beautiful country and that’s where my family is from. My love for Cuba doesn’t mean I can’t think that the US is the great country on the planet and that I want to live anywhere else.Having a Cuban flag is no different than having a confederate flag, or a flag from wherever your heritage comes from. It’s just a piece of cloth, don’t look so deep into it. This isn’t the same as Kaepernick praising Castro or wearing a Che shirt. He was promoting their ideas. She is as well, but it’s not because she wore the flag. Think of how this would be in reverse.  If someone went to another country, made a big fuss, and demanded the implementation of American laws and American culture there.  The flags themselves are relevant to the situation.  Also relevant, because he was a rabid Communist shitlib who executed people.  He was an awful human being.  Wearing his likeness means the wearer agrees with such awfulness, or is too ignorant to understand what they're endorsing with his image.  I see where you’re coming from, and it definitely happens. Plenty of people in Cuba wearing clothes with American symbols on them. Only difference is those people aren’t even from here. Heritage should be celebrated because people should never forget where they came from. That doesn’t mean you can’t love where you are just as much, if not more. I love being of Cuban descent, but I also love being American and I wouldn’t trade that for anything else. This situation is only a bad look because of who is wearing the flag and the message they’re trying to push. That’s like saying conservative Americans shouldn’t wear anything California related because their government is run by a bunch of idiots. California itself is beautiful, despite the government being shit. In Cuba she wouldn't be allowed to open her mouth and protest shit.  So to have the Cuban flag on her shoulder while protesting is really, ironic.(Edit) So....her family is from Cuba, so I don't see a huge issue with this anymore.  If that weren't the case, it would be Holy WTF time...All previous communist societies collapsed before everyone starved to death, so they couldn't have been true communism.

They should try and convince the undecided, shouldn't they?Sad thing this fucking creature never lived in Cuba. She cannot fathom what it is like to not have electricity for 5 days out of the week. No running or hot water, no beef, barely any food, hiding the pig you had been raising for the last year to be able to feed your family form the government. No right to free speech, no right to anything. It took me 5 years to become a US citizen and I consider myself more American than Cuban because this country has given me everything. I challenge these kids to look at the other side of the coin so that they can appreciate all the things they have. These kids have zero perpsective outside of what indoctrination has happened to them... Glad you made it here safe fellow pede  :) These kids have zero perpsective outside of what indoctrination has happened to them... Glad you made it here safe fellow pede  :) They’re children who’ve suffered tragedy and are being used as political props. They deserve some sympathy and counseling, and then need to get on with their lives. They are too young and uneducated to know what they’re talking about. Look at that gleeful smile. Her classmates are murdered but the media loves her! God this shameful whoring for attention must hurt so bad for the the family members of the victims. Yeah, and why the fuck aren't we revoking their citizenships and deporting them? I'm an immigrant, still to go through the naturalization, and I know that being a communist or an anti-American is, at least, on paper, is a big no-no. So, who the fuck is not following the law? fuck these fuckers. Get them the fuck out.=Yeah, and why the fuck aren't we revoking their citizenships and deporting them?

God, I truly despise CNN.Do you guys even commie? It's the koolest kraze among the kids. Fight the power man, revolution, fuck the bourgeoise. What mom? Oh, it's time for skool, g2g guys!Its clear that all of the sponsors of this event are promoting radicals, as TuckerCarlson (adorable man) pointed out. People who support communism should be exiled. Liquidate all their assets give them a check send them to a communist Nation of their choosing and if they don't choose spin a wheel. And let them live out the rest of their days in their ideal ParadiseOh that would be an amazing show. Especially if we keep track of them for one year just checking in on them.Oh that would be an amazing show.

No guns, free healthcare, free university. She can then attain a degree in mechanical engineering and go work in the tourism industry... AS A WAITER. I'm trying to get someone from a fanatical cess pool liberal sub to just tell me what the gun laws are in Cuba,  and instead of getting an answer,  I'm getting hate,  anger and bunch of weird responses... very odd. Let me guess ... raised by a single mother receiving tons of bennies at taxpayer expense with a history of drug and alcohol abuse.As annoying and wrong as these kids are - they are kids - their cortexes are not developed and they lack relative life experience. There is little hope they will change, but it’s possible, unlike anyone over 30 still spouting this nonsense. I’m still totally gonna keep making fun of them. dont want to defend her....believe me, but maybe she's cuban??? i was at a cuban restaruant in miami and then had cuban flags. I love this country.  That's why I joined the army...but seeing shit like this....how can people be so misguided....SMH ... cuban Floridian desperately left that shithole not to see that now millenials are glorifying that tyrant shithole.Cunt needs shipped there in a box and citizenship revoked. See how they enjoy a government where only the government has guns. Do we know if she's here legally?  It would almost be worth calling ICE just to report and make sure.  You win some, you lose some. Are you guys retarded? Her parents immigrated from Cuba in 68. Its just showing her heritage, not necesarily showing a support of communism. Being against guns =/= being a communist.Being out and proud protesting against individual rights and personal liberty has the undeniable stink of communistic tyranny. you believe that bearing a firearm is an individual right and personal liberty and not a right caused by a colonized america being opressed by a tyrannic british government? the right to bear a firearm was never an individual right or personal liberty under the age of enlightenment.Nah fuck this, we were called nazis for saying that America belonged to its citizens and that there are some fundamentally flawed ideas in political Islamism that results in dead bodies.isnt there some fundamentally flawed ideas in "america belonging to its citizens" that result in dead bodies?Do you protect your home and your property or do you opt out of the fact because somewhere in the past somebody had to lose their ground for you to gain yours?Being out and proud protesting against individual rights and personal liberty has the undeniable stink of communistic tyranny. you believe that bearing a firearm is an individual right and personal liberty and not a right caused by a colonized america being opressed by a tyrannic british government? the right to bear a firearm was never an individual right or personal liberty under the age of enlightenment.We have the smartest pedes , too bad sjws don't understand what a "first" or "second" amendment" actually are. Saw a minivan in Tucson today with a march poster taped to the side. Proudly locked eyes and said fuck off and gave HeSheorIt a middle finger. HeSheorIt rolled up their window lmaoNBC evening news just compared the marchers to the civil rights movement.. You can't make this shit up.. My wife plays Lester Holt to know what leftists are saying.  When he compared these manipulated children to Martin Luther King’s movement it was cringe inducing.  I do the same with NPR.  15 minutes is about all it takes to get the full leftist narrative for the day.  After about 10 minutes I'm ready to rip my radio out of the dash board and repeatedly run it over, so I usually tune out.  Even 10 minutes has become too much lately.  Endless toxicity, lies, and framing the argument in an alternate liberal universe, totally detached from the reality I see and hear every day. Fun Fact: I used to do the same as you, but then I stopped listening to NPR when they cut that conservative guys interview, while they live!! 
It was during 2016, but before election, and the interview was live. The interviewer obviously wasn’t able to be a journalist/unbiased, so, facts and civil conversation weren’t allowed. Therefore, he stopped the interview after being only mere minutes longs. 
The next day, NPR announced a policy, that they would prerecord all interviews with conservatives. Sadly, I haven’t tuned in since. 
Good for you for staying open-minded...Well, identity politics in general. I like to see how long it takes for them to mention race, sex, gender, orientation, etc. It's rarely over 3 minutes. Ha. Me too. I not too long ago was arguing with my dad about NPR being relatively moderate. Crazy how much my politics have changed in the last two years. I say that I listen to NPR to know what the Commies are doing. They don't get that a lot of people are like me and are just burnt out over all this shit. Everyday has to be some brand new spectacle, every news report has to be some brand new controversy, and goddamn it you will hear our opinions about everything cause we're gonna shove it down your throats whether you want to hear it anyways. Their words mean nothing except for the absurdly tiny percentage of people across the country who are just as fuming and rampant mad as the rest of them.Kamel Harris compared the current situation to Selma, from back in those days.  Made a rhythmic, repetitive speech... "look to Selma... look to Selma".  Like a chant, or an incantation. It's eerie.  As they they're trying to summon a spirit.  And they use the energy of children to do it.  How does that make any sense? Civil rights movement was about extending rights, this march is about restricting rights. You don't get it. Our rights are limiting their ability to live. For them to have freedom, WE need to be controlled. This is a civil rights movement to those loons.I seen a lot of people pushing that.  They really are trying to recreate the 60's and failing miserably.  Morons.It's racial pandering by the leftists. They don't know what the Civil Rights movement was really about or how impactful it actually was in the grand scheme of things, so they think: "Hey they took to the streets with signs, and we took to the streets with signs. We're the same! See black people, we're the same as you!" Except the black people of the 60s took to the streets with signs full knowing they were going to run into hostile police forces who would spray them down with firehoses and sic hunting dogs on them to scare them away. These kids went into the street with signs knowing...that they might get a little sunburnt today and maybe they'll be tired after walking 3 miles and holding up signs, so let's plan to stop at Mickey D's afterwards.I mean, look at all some of the pathetic photos from today's march. You got old granny's, people in wheelchairs, noodle-armed McHogg and even little children all running around, smiling and cheering. Yeah that's not a real march. Next time, march somewhere and for something that will get you possibly locked up if you want me to admire your "courage." March for Women's Rights in Iran. Then I will literally be in awe of your bravery.My wife plays Lester Holt to know what leftists are saying.

So stupid to hear these alarmist cucks overreact to the concept of armed teachers or any guns in a school, when they're so ignorant that they don't realize it was commonplace for students to carry guns when schools had marksmen clubs.Today was my birthday so my dad took me to the local gun range and I got to shoot a .33 Winchester for the first time. It was awesome!! These guys let me shoot an AR-15 and I now support the second amendment even more. These people asking for their rights to be taken away don't know what they're missing. Best birthday ever!Now this is what I would call a safe space, well trained gun afficiandos. A terrorist wouldn't be able to even finish shouting allah amongst this crowd there would be no akbar.i've never heard of a kid on a shooting team or in the NRA, being a school shooter, or a gang member, ever.on the other hand, drugged out, fatherless kids, who are mentally ill (but not locked up in mental institutions like they should be) or who are in gangs are the ones doing ALL of the killing.Lets deal with the real problems.  Lack of fatherhood, mental illness, and gang members killing other gang members.But safe, responsible, and social shooting clubs and events are NEVER the problem.  In fact thing like that make our kids, and our schools safer, and our country stronger.i've never heard of a kid on a shooting team or in the NRA, being a school shooter, or a gang member, ever.on the other hand, drugged out, fatherless kids, who are mentally ill (but not locked up in mental institutions like they should be) or who are in gangs are the ones doing ALL of the killing.Lets deal with the real problems.

They probably just want to disarm the people who need to protect themselves. My son says he will just make his own.  And he would too.  he thinks these gun control kids are stupid bc and I quote "dude it's not like a gun is that complicated of a machine to build.  I could make one of those in my sleep.""   and he could he's handy like that.Kinda tricky unless you can buy all of the parts, you could make some sort of combustion type handcannon pretty easy, or a pipe gun.

That thing was so lazy, it could have qualified for food stamps.Every spring for the past few years, it seems like we get some new Democrat "rallying cry" of protest marches.     Then the libs, media and celebrities spaz out about their most recent cause. $oros funds them. They become extreme with their demands, lashing out with their hatred and desire to control other people. Pelosi and company use the propaganda to try turning it into Democrat votes.     Lol occupy Wall Street has become a forgotten joke at this point. Then they had black lives matter which are irrelevant now without there actually being a systemic problem of racist cops. I guess it all goes away if there really isn't a problem. That Maryland shooting went away quickly too. Cuz there was a badass with a gun protecting the school. I have a friend who was highly involved in the Long Beach CA occupy group. The whole thing was such a shit show.  She became obsessively involved in it over the course of a month or two and it consumed her whole identity like a cult.  She still feels like that time period defines her and who she is.  They didn't let her speak at meetings because she was white because they are racist intersectionalists.  She was arrested at one point for protesting and had all sorts of legal trouble (which actually red pilled her on 2A as she lost all faith in the police based on how they treated her)The whole thing sounded more like Burning Man in the park;  mostly white hipsters living in a public park, smoking weed and fucking until their neetbucks ran out or they got arrested.I asked her what their goals were, she couldn't articulate a single thing and just sort of laughed it off.  She told me to ask her buddy; one of the top leaders of the Long Beach movement.  When I asked him he just chuckled and said he had no idea either.  Pathetic!!!That's fucking sad. Just keep to your music festivals and let the adults who know about tax rates and go insane about budgets do the political commentating thank you. What is the attitude toward this omnibus from the left. Obviously Chuck and Nancy gloated but what's the blue check mark crowd saying?I don't know, that group of friends learned not to talk politics with me a while ago.

My family hadn't heard anything about "the school shooting in Maryland this week."   For some of us it's everyday, I find I can no longer sustain without a constant supply of these delicious memes. TD is truly best sub for good laughs at libtards. Our pressence alone disturbs them lol, terrifies them that the silent majority has a corner with a voice still.It’s amazing how many threads/conversations got nuked and destroyed from this sub in response to the omnibus bill.  Censorship and fascism seems to be creeping in here doesn’t it.?  Are we going to start destroying statues or destroying books because of conversation?It looks like Pres. Trump has taken Saturday off from any shit posting. He usally has some spice on Sat.Day is not over and still got Sunday.spez really nice post OP.He doesn’t deserve any spice after signing a bill like that folks, believe me.  Welcome to the swamp MR President...they’ve been waiting for you to fall in line.Ok, you're not being fair. Do you know how disastrous it would have been to shut down the gov't in the midst of trade negotiations w/ China & talks w/ N Korea?? And don't forget abt Nafta talks! Everyone had already left town, who was going to come back to fix the budget?  And do you think he would have been able to get a better deal?!?!?!?It wasn't easy but at least it only lasts for 6 months! Let's lick our wounds and get behind Trump!  This man is in such a tough position w/ no help from the Dems or Repubs  plus having to endure so many attacks at the same time!!!We really need to understand this and support this man!  It wasn't easy and he doesn't like it any more than you do!Wow... how ignorant are you? Are you in middle school?  How long do you think negotiations between China, NK have been going on?  How long have talks about trade been going on?  Decades?  Centuries?  You don’t know how to frame a discussion my friend.Yeah, but you sure do.  You think it's a good idea to shutdown the government now?!?!?!  There are much higher priorities he has to deal with right now!  I didn't like it either but Trump had to be the grown-up and make a hard decision. That's what a true leader does.
And he's taking the hit for it.  What he is doing is really a thankless job but thank God he is willing to do it.Shut it down.  The negotiations would still happen you idiot.  He’s playing into the wants of defense contracts and he’s giving the swamp everything they want at the same time.  Fuck off and stop slinging your ignorant bullshit.  You are not on an even level of conversation.Oh please, grow up already. You just don't get it! It's a distraction they don't need right now. The bill is only temporary, only 6 months!  And you think they would have gotten a better deal after the veto?!?!?  Mattis came to him and begged him to sign the bill!!!  So tell me, wise one, what would you have told Mattis!?!?! Since you know so much!  Honey, go fuck yourself, I'm staying RIGHT HERE!!  I'll never leave Trump alone on the battlefield while he's taking fire from all sides.  He put everything on the line for us and this country. I'll never let morons like you tear him down.You can go fuck yourself with a rake “HONEY”. This was an obviously absurd spending bill.  Bad decisions are ok to call out.  He could have vetoed and signed a CR and let congress vote on the bill to pass themselves.  Yup and just shut down the government. Do you work for a living? Forget it, I forgot when you argue with a fool listeners can't tell the difference. I should have ended this awhile ago. I'm done with you. Have fun with your rake loser.And, I still support.  Signing this bill was an obvious bad move for this administration.  I can still support and remain critical or opinionated.He doesn’t deserve any spice after signing a bill like that folks, believe me.

It wasn't easy and he doesn't like it any more than you do!Wow... how ignorant are you? Are you in middle school?  How long do you think negotiations between China, NK have been going on?  How long have talks about trade been going on?  Decades?  Centuries?  You don’t know how to frame a discussion my friend.Yeah, but you sure do.  You think it's a good idea to shutdown the government now?!?!?!  There are much higher priorities he has to deal with right now!  I didn't like it either but Trump had to be the grown-up and make a hard decision. That's what a true leader does.
And he's taking the hit for it.  What he is doing is really a thankless job but thank God he is willing to do it.Shut it down.  The negotiations would still happen you idiot.  He’s playing into the wants of defense contracts and he’s giving the swamp everything they want at the same time.  Fuck off and stop slinging your ignorant bullshit.  You are not on an even level of conversation.Oh please, grow up already. You just don't get it! It's a distraction they don't need right now. The bill is only temporary, only 6 months!  And you think they would have gotten a better deal after the veto?!?!?  Mattis came to him and begged him to sign the bill!!!  So tell me, wise one, what would you have told Mattis!?!?! Since you know so much!  Honey, go fuck yourself, I'm staying RIGHT HERE!!  I'll never leave Trump alone on the battlefield while he's taking fire from all sides.  He put everything on the line for us and this country. I'll never let morons like you tear him down.You can go fuck yourself with a rake “HONEY”. This was an obviously absurd spending bill.  Bad decisions are ok to call out.  He could have vetoed and signed a CR and let congress vote on the bill to pass themselves.  Yup and just shut down the government. Do you work for a living? Forget it, I forgot when you argue with a fool listeners can't tell the difference. I should have ended this awhile ago. I'm done with you. Have fun with your rake loser.And, I still support.  Signing this bill was an obvious bad move for this administration.  I can still support and remain critical or opinionated.Ok, you're not being fair. Do you know how disastrous it would have been to shut down the gov't in the midst of trade negotiations w/ China & talks w/ N Korea?? And don't forget abt Nafta talks! Everyone had already left town, who was going to come back to fix the budget?  And do you think he would have been able to get a better deal?!?!?!?It wasn't easy but at least it only lasts for 6 months! Let's lick our wounds and get behind Trump!

That's why it's easier for the shooters to kill them. They've not seen any humanity or compassion from any them.I'm not exactly sure any of these shooters were actually bullied.  Like in almost every case, the shooters are deranged individuals who drove people away from them.The ONLY case in which this was different was Klebold/Harris, and even in that case, only Klebold really follows the 'bullied victim' narrative.Look at their letters, their manifestos.  They believe they're above others, and that mistaken belief drove them to their actions.He was also on the autism spectrum, never spoke in complete sentences, constantly wore sunglasses indoors, whispered when he did speak in a deep voice that scared people, constantly took upskirt photos of women RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM and wrote obscene and violent poetry about them, and frightened multiple staff members of his university to the point where they had to work out secret codes if he got violent with them. This isn't bullying if the person who's being excluded is a fucking terrible excuse of a human being.Rather than taking guns or shaking one's finger at society in general, maybe we should acknowledge that some people cannot be saved, and that their minds may be so warped that there's nothing less than either institutionalization or euthanasia that can deal with it.Show me an example of a school shooter who DIDN'T make you think of either a sociopath or the autism spectrum.Bullying is real.  It's terrible.  And a lot of research from the 90's and before was embarrassingly naive.  But it's hard to tease out whether or not these school shooter types were bullied or just(RIGHTFULLY) ostracised by their peers for being awful people.  We can't trust their manifestos, they ARE ill, and most were good enough liars to hide their intentions for months if not years.I’d argue both are true. Likely the bullying led to closing ones self off by pushing people away, maybe an old friend betrayed someone when going to middle school that starts the cycle. Or maybe they had slight personality disorders which caused the bullying for not being “normal” and self perpetuated. I’ve seen this happen in school and if you’re honest you have too, it’s not completely black and white. In the recipe to make a school shooter, the batter might be mental illness, but bullying is the oven and the author forgot to mention how long this recipe for disaster needs to bake. Look at their letters, their manifestos. They believe they're above others, and that mistaken belief drove them to their actions.Which is super easy to believe if everybody else treats you like shit.

But hey, why not let them restructure the foundations of our society- they'd be great at that.David "Attention" Hogg needs to be taken down a few pegs. He also needs to shut the fuck up. Such an annoying little bitch. I cannot wait until the real world hits this kid like a fucking train that has no brakes, or perhaps a metric shitton of bricks that we could be using to build the wall. Let's see if he is still liberal once he is out on his own and not in FUCKING HIGH SCHOOL living under his parents roof where the largest problems you have are miniscule in comparison to adulthood. You think the principal's office is bad, kid? Wait until you have to deal with the IRS. I do find it hilarious he has already been rejected from several universities AFAIK. Good luck in the real world ya pompous fuck. At that rate, it would take approximately 7.584 years to travel to the Andromeda Galaxy (2.5 million light-years)!I cannot wait until the real world hits this kid like a fucking train that has no brakes, or perhaps a metric shitton of bricks that we could be using to build the wall.

A true revolution usually ends in violence. Since they can't legally own guns, and many behind them choose not to, it would be a very rapid, one-sided affair. That weeny armed Derp State junior officer couldn't throw one of them back in without hurting ximself. And ho lee phuk you know xis aim sucks.That weeny armed Derp State junior officer couldn't throw one of them back in without hurting ximself. And ho lee phuk you know xis aim sucks.Yeah we had a real revolution in 1776.  Resulted in among other things the bill of rights which helps keeps tyrants off our backs.  Hogg should look it up.This is what I've been saying. HOW the hell are liberals aka no guns pussy snowflakes going to take gun from any one. People with gun support 2A no gun no 2A. How do people with out gun take them from people who do have guns. Start a civil war you little shit a Democrat/liberal will never get elected again because there won't be any left after the war dem politician or voters. Don't pick a fight you can't win. Tide pod eating pussy.They hope to vote and make the government (armed with guns) come take them and leave law abiding citizens defenseless.Hahaha. Government! that would be the military the rest of the gov is inept. They took a survey some year ago found out that the military would not follow those orders or turn on them up to 2/3.  So us plus 2/3 of the military we win.How did two little girls scapegoat the entire town of Salem? Children are powerful, when supported by the right powers.The state must declare the child to be the most precious treasure of the people. As long as the government is perceived as working for the benefit of the children, the people will happily endure almost any curtailment of liberty and almost any deprivation. - Adolf HitlerCurrently reading mein kamph, not exactly easy reading but it is astounding the similarities between what he thought was a good idea and current shitlib ideology. Very, very insightful. More people should read it along with the communist manifesto, and koran, we must understand the enemy General first red flag: when people argue for curtailment of liberty without using facts or meaningful statistics. It's the typical authoritarian first move.It was probably why it's been banned for so long, the left don't want people knowing that the Nazis were leftists.Can we stop with this? There are many red pilled people in that generation and there's ample evidence to say Gen Z'ers are very conservative.

Where could it get those, I wonder?  Perhaps in high school?Start a revolution? Why don't you liberal teens step up and be a friend to the outcasts in school before they become beta male rampage killers. Take a look at the criminal profile. Loners, not many friends, dissatisfied with life. Step up if you see them getting bullied, and you've seen it. Step up if you see they have no friends, and you've seen it. Step up. So often people have said they knew this was coming, yet they did nothing. If you want to start a revolution, start by analyzing the perpetrators of this type of crime. What do many of them have in common? Then help them and show them your humanity, that you care. I totally agree...we need a revolutionary war. It'll be alpha-centipedes vs beta-cucks. Guess who has the gins and will be victorious?100 million patriots...  somewhere over 600 million guns,  with way over a trillion rounds...  yea.  good luck with your stupid little "revolution"  retard...I read something recently, I don't remember where, that communists in Nazi-occupied France didn't have guns so they resorted to sabotage.So, let me get this straight, a bunch of people without guns want to start a war with a bunch of people with guns?Read about Gandhi and the Indian freedom struggle movement. Won without guns. Beat the largest colonial empire of all time."If you think you're strong because you have a gun, you'll also be the weakest when you lose it"
-BatmanI'm for more gun control (unlike most of you guys here, I know) and I am probably more liberal than conservative (again, unlike most of you guys here), but even I have to say that I think this guy is seriously using the tragedy to sell himself/profit for himself, which is not helping the overall cause.  He's just making it worse for people who actually want to make change.Killer Mike is interesting. He's a self proclaimed capitalist, but likes Bernie because he thinks Bernie is in touch with black communities. Loves the Constitution and is pro gun. His song "Reagan" is about how Presidents are controlled by corporations. I think we should try and get an AMA out of him. He may be a Bernie guy, but he's intelligent nonetheless.He is pretty clearly focused on the wellbeing of the black community. Which is cool, I think he has good intentions and he's not worried about offending those around him. But he is definitely part of a group.Killer Mike's raps outside of "Run the Jewels" were always really smart and thoughtful.  His raps as part of "Run the Jewels" are very often kind of lazy and predictable "shit talking".  The group is a huge waste of his talent and just doesn't bring out the best in him.  Same for El-P.  His primary tie to Bernie is Bernie's connection with the black community. He makes a big point about the pictures of Bernie being arrested during the Civil rights movement. He also hated the fact that Hillary was backed immensely by super pacs and special interest. I think an ama on here would be hilarious. Dude hates Reagan and trump so much he literally threw a bbq to celebrate Reagan’s death. ‘Ronald Reagan was an actor, not at all a factor, just another employee of the country’s real masters’ comes from his song Reagan, which ends with the line ‘I’ll leave you with four words: I’m glad Reagan’s dead...Ronald (six) Wilson (six) Reagan (six)’ and the whole song is about how Reagan lied to the American public about illegal arms deals and spearheaded the war on drugs while importing cocaine from Colombia straight to the streets via the CIA, which has been devastating for the inner city communities that are the target of the drug war, to say the least. Not to mention he had a line on a song last year about how trump fucks Ivanka. But yeah, get him for an ama and see how that goes over.He is pretty clearly focused on the wellbeing of the black community. Which is cool, I think he has good intentions and he's not worried about offending those around him. But he is definitely part of a group.He is pretty clearly focused on the wellbeing of the black community.

His raps as part of "Run the Jewels" are very often kind of lazy and predictable "shit talking".  The group is a huge waste of his talent and just doesn't bring out the best in him.  Same for El-P.

It was only while bernie was in the race that he was outspokenly against HillaryHe did support her over trump thou, said on the view if i remember right after RTJ dropped 2100 in the days after the election. It was only while bernie was in the race that he was outspokenly against HillaryI have the feeling he is way more MAGA Mike behind the scenes. The dude loves freedom, guns, women, weed, and capitalism. He values his privacy. He believes any gun that can be obtained by the federal government and armed forces should be available to private citizens. I think he started supporting Bernie because of his statements on the Voting Rights Act."They asked me, will you do this anti-bullying drop for radio? Absolutely not. Why? Because your child needs to get punched in the face so he can learn to punch someone back. And that isn't saying that it's right to be punched in the face, that's saying that sure as you're an adult something or someone is going to punch you in your fucking face. And you have to develop the aptitude and the fortitude to fight back."Because its all about promoting weakness and trying to bring others down to their level. This is something I hoped where black cynicsm and self preservation instinct would produce a more fundamental split with the left. More black ppl realize its not about getting resources from "the man" with them its about nihilists using you as a perpetual martyr.Exactly what LEO could realistically be able to provide such defense or be liable for every citizen. This aint lile Bruce Almighty answering the prayer inbox, and they info from the public too. I don't always agree with Killer Mike about politics, but he is genuinely one of the nicest dudes out there making music, and I say this as someone who has met him more than once.  He is also, in his thought processes, generally not a "follower", doesn't care what's popular, he makes up his own mind.  Black people by in large love their guns, because they know you have to look out for yourself sometimes.  On the flip side you’ve got a rich white kid telling us to disarm. Democrats have horrible messaging. I feel like gum control advocates need to directly address the use of force in the police- ie., doesn't the argument that you don't need guns to protect yourself from other people with guns because the police will/should be protecting you stand directly opposed to those who say the police are violent and don't do their job by definition?Some of the people over at hiphopheads are such babies about him saying what he said. As much as they talk about black rights and racial injustice you would think they would be okay with black people having thoughts different from them. They did the same shit to Kanye. The radical left is so cancerous and evil.Cops are 10 minutes away, but that beautiful gun is within arms reach. Our founders were smart, badass men. Supposedly, the police response to an active shooter is 3 minutes. I got shot at, and after the cunt left, I called the cops. They showed up 20 minutes later and declared it was, "Probably kids making dumb decisions." We even found out who he was a couple days later and he wasn't charged, because supposedly he could just claim someone else was driving his vehicle (that he was shooting from).Its what happened at parkland. And even they do you might have to wait for another district police force to come.Yep. This is the biggest red pill on guns ive found. What happens if someone breaks into your house? Lets say you hear them and your in another room and manage to call 911? Ok great! Now what happens in the next 10min? They rob and kill you. If you want to test it yourself, get a stopwatch and then record how long it takes to walk out to your car and drive to your nearest police station.Why do we always go back to the self defense part of owning guns.  2A is about stopping a tyrannical government, not self defense or hunting.  I feel that using these arguments gives good cause to limit the kind of weapons citizens can own.Is stopping a tyrannical government not self defense?
Its self preservation after all.
But most people use it in the example of home invasion and attacks because it's where it really matters in a practical sense. 
Most people are of the belief that if you give an inch, the government will take a mile, and that's why they don't want limits on their guns, and that's also why the narrative is drawn back to self defense. The fear is more regulation will result in a complete ban in the long run, and that regular people will be stripped of a powerful defense.Its the simplest red pill to start from, then you can move from that, to post Katrina to give people an idea of what social breakdown looks like, then you can move from that to " the most common infantryman weapon " when referring to the unorganized militia, and how a dictator's goal is to establish a police state, not to massively drone, bomb and cannon their own territory, but thats kinda hard to do with millions of people armed with the civilian equivalent of...the most common infantryman weapon.In real life, the vast majority of firearm homicides are carried out by young black males against other young black males, in urban areas.Anyone who wants to talk about gun violence needs to address these facts first, if I’m going to take them seriously. Anything else is just ignorant blathering, at best, or deceitful propaganda, at worst.It's ironically racist violence in ghettos is ignored, yet we are in mourning over a bunch of suburban kids. Whatever fits your narrative is convenient,  fuck all the rest. For decades, Leftists ignore the horrendous gun violence in predominately black, poor areas, but as soon as some wealthy white kids get shot, ooooh, everyone gets woke...Its the broken family dynamics and the drug war pipeline. It only exists because its constantly subsidized and then neglected.It's ironically racist violence in ghettos is ignored, yet we are in mourning over a bunch of suburban kids.

Love his conviction to speak up despite knowing the hate he would face. He's a good man. Respect. Sometimes you have to protect yourself from cops as well. What country without guns has a non corrupt police force?If I were a student there, I would make a cheap liner for backpacks and sell them to the rest of the students.Just think of how many silencers a school shooter could fit in their non-clear backpack...scary stuff!Will these clear plastic backpacks come with suffocation warnings though... That's the Real question.Lmao I just realized you can get around the clear backpack rule by putting everything in non-clear bags inside the backpackThat's not going far enough. We need to ban all backpacks that have 2 or more military features ( such as zippers, arm straps, and buckles).Yep, the military uses zippers, straps and buckles.  Why do civilian backpacks need those things as well???Hahaha, nice. Also, Parkland kids want to be safe, then REEEEEE when the safety measure is border control, LOL Ok, good.  I thought I was about to go against the grain thinking that maybe a clear backpack wouldn't be so bad... Promotes organization and you know... No guns and stuff.

Also, Parkland kids want to be safe, then REEEEEE when the safety measure is border control, LOL Hey kiddo, I bet your school has a dress code. The backpack will be part of the dress code. Go back to school. You might disagree with him, but here is the thing: the right to wear an opaque backpack is in the bill of rights. So you can't really make him wear a clear one. Gun rights? It's not like that's the 2A or anything..A well regulated safe-space being necessary to the feelings of a soyboy, the right of the snowflakes to keep and bear non-clear backpacks shall not be infringed.We're very OK with kids not having full rights if there is reason for it. It's why the under 21 gun bans are 2A violations but the under 18 gun bans are not.Bingo! If NRA had our backs they would have had the 21 age restriction shot down the year it was introduced way back in 1968. Denying, natural, God given rights to grown adults is not something we should have ever gotten comfortable with. The under 21 handgun thing was legal on the pre-DC v. Heller and pre-McDonald v. Chicago interpretation of 2A. That is, only arms related to serving in a militia were covered by 2A before those cases, and States were not covered by 2A. Since both of those cases, 2A is a personal right, not a right of militias, and is incorporated against the States.Basically, NRA had no ground to fight on in 1968. They have grounds to fight on now, and we might see a challenge to under-21 handgun restrictions if the challenge to under-21 rifles goes well.Could get an argument about protection against unreasonable searches, but that ship sailed before these HS kids were in pre-k. We basically don't accept the premise that school kids at school have that protection.I get searched every time I get on a plane or into the court house. Not saying it's right or wrong, just pointing out clear backpacks are not nearly as intrusive as other areas of our lives.People under the age of majority don't enjoy most rights. 2A rights, for example. 1A, too: an adult could insult a teacher with no repercussions, but a student will (should, anyway) get disciplined. For 4A, there are schools where students are subject to metal detectors and searches on entry. Same deal applies there: the rights guaranteed to adults are just suggestions for kids.I’m honestly starting to think after these stupid marches & demonstrations that we should take serious, concrete steps to further limit the 1st amendment rights of children.As you point out; children under 18 cannot purchase firearms, children under 16 cannot drive on their own / unsupervised; maybe its time we restrict their 1st amendment rights, see how they like that.Schools already enforce dress codes, whether that's a school uniform or just a few restrictions here and there, the precedent is set. This isn't the first school to do clear backpacks either.Uh, he could wear a normal backpack anywhere at any time he wanted. As long as that "anywhere" isn't his school and "any time" isn't school hours.The moment the Deep State realize he is no longer useful to their agenda, and in fact having the reverse of the desired effect in many cases, he'll be gone.Fuck these retarded media whore opportunists.  When I was 18, the backpack I wore was OD Green with a "US" stamped on it and I carried an M-60 machine gun to work every day on a nuke site in Germany.  I didn't survive nuclear combat toe-to-toe with the Russkis to have some triangle-noggin, pencil-necked geek with pipe cleaner arms try to take away my basic human right to self-defense.Military Police.  The nuclear combat part was an exaggeration but a very real possibility during that era.  We had signs in our barracks that said "World War III could start tomorrow: Are You Ready?".Not surprising.  I’ve donated to PP and their paranoia was unbelievable also that it turned me off from the organization for good.the 500K that signed up need to call for La Pierre to step down, since he's the one promoting bump stock bansTo quote Ben Shapiro: "Why can't you identify as 60? And by the way, you can't legally change your age!"That or that he's a fucking moron who isn't going to have a high school degree.  (did he actually follow through with his "im nut gon go to skewl until they a gun banz")This is why kids don't belong in politics, and don't have the right to vote. Unfortunately this kid is going to be just as dumb when he turns 18. "Interest in politics" does not mean using the deaths of your peers to push a factually incorrect position in order to take away rights. Also funded by soros, the cherry on top of the shit sundae. Tool. Tool of the msm. They will use him until he is done. Hollywood dose the same when it comes to children. May be so, but more importantly, he is being used as a tool.  The left is using kids to push an emotionally driven anti gun agenda.  Do not underestimate this scrawny soyboy Man he's just a kid, I was fucking moron at his age too, the sad thing is that CNN is essentially grabbing a child and using them as a sock puppet knowing that any criticism of him can be dismissed as "attacking a victim".  He's like 17, he knows fucking nothing, he parrots what he is told, and he is told that the NRA is responsible for the shooting. Not the kid who did the shooting, not the cops who never charged the psycho so he could never get a gun in the first place, not the school cop who stood outside and listened to the massacre, not the foster parents who let a fucking nutcase kid have access to rifle whenever he wanted. It means he is ignorant, inexperienced, and headstrong. He speaks with authority on subjects he knows nothing about. People who are mentally unfit are very often incapable of buying firearms, but yes a greater emphasis must be placed on ripping away archaic protections on the mentally ill. It is extremely difficult if not outright illegal to have a mentally ill person involuntarily committed and after being involuntarily committed that record must be able to appear on background checks. The ACLU fights tooth and nail to have these nonsensical protections kept in place throughout the US so take the issue up with them. We dont need better background checks they are already comprehensive, we need to have common sense laws regarding the mentally ill.I'm not advocating for free healthcare, I am advocating for involuntary psychiatric commitment that will show up on a background check just like being proven incompetent in court or having a felony.That's a problem that will never be able to be solved. There will always be treatments beyond what people can afford. The mentally ill often take too little or too much of their meds, or get put on the wrong one, or have bad withdrawals from one, or aren't on meds at all. The only thing society can do is put a warning label on saying "this person is not in control of themselves and and therefore cannot have a firearm".If someone - whether they’re a convicted criminal out on parole, or someone with some sort of “mental issue” and we feel they should not be allowed to own firearms, why are they being allowed to roam free anyway?If he cannot see the fundamental logical fallacy of complaining about his clear backpack being a punishment for the misdeeds of others, while lobbying to take away fundamental rights from people due to the misdeeds of others, he is by definition stupid.“Sick and tired” implies they happen all the time - they don’t. That’s another media lie you’ve swallowed.I’m sick & tired of being demonized as a literal accessory to mass murder each time some the government literally allows, virtually invites some nutjob to go commit crimes.The failure of government at each & every level is so epic and thorough that it almost has to have been intentional.Yet I and all other law-abiding gun owners, who are statistically higher-educated, higher-income, and more law-abiding than people who don’t own guns (its a statistical fact - look it up) get smeared as inbred racist murderers each time some dumbass democrat commits a crime.I’m “sick & tired’ of all these left-wing morons literally throwing temper tantrums and opposing any actual, meaningful, realistic and tangible solutions such as increasing school security, arming teachers, providing more SROs, etc. Fuck, my wife was just telling me she read that there are apparently thousands of schools that don’t have proper locks on their goddamn doors.I'd like us to go easier on the kid.  When I was his age I also was a fucking moron.  That's why kids aren't allowed to vote, because they haven't reached any level of wisdom yet still act like they know it all.Not cool that he's being paraded around by big media conglomerates to push an agenda, but that's more on the fault of those companies.This kid is propagandized to from his leftist school and government system, and likely his FBI father has tried to shift the blame of his and his department's failings onto law abiding citizens taking advantage of their 2nd amendment right.You saw the Shifty Sheriff do the same thing by blaming guns and not his own cowardice and poor training of his department.I guess what I'm trying to say is save any vitriol for those who are pulling the strings.  This kid may come out of his stupor at some point.  Maybe he'll read a few books on our founding fathers.  Take a few constitutional law classes, have a based professor or two.  He was conducting interviews calling for legislative change - while the shooting was happening in another building.  Oh fuck off. Listen to the way this kid talks and youll feel no sympathy for him. Hes a rude little shit who should have been hit more as a child. I agree completely that he's a rude little shit.  He was shaped by his rude shitty parents and leftist education (indoctrination).  Let us not condemn this child for the sins of his parents.He isn’t intelligent enough to see the contradictions in lobbying to restrict the specifically Constitutionally enumerated rights of American citizens while simultaneously whining about “muh rights” when it comes to clear backpacks. If the kid only gets positive results from acting like a douch, what kind of adult will he become? Everything else aside with the lefty media exploit inng him and all... nah, fuck this guy.I'd agree if Hogg wasn't a public figure, and perhaps you don't think he's a public figure. Since he has campaigned against the second amendment in TV interviews, I'm not as willing to give him that much slack.He’s been through a lot, and now has a million adults telling him how to feel and think. I can’t blame him, he is too young to know he is being used.You might disagree with him, but here is the thing: the right to wear an opaque backpack is in the bill of rights. So you can't really make him wear a clear one. Gun rights?

"Interest in politics" does not mean using the deaths of your peers to push a factually incorrect position in order to take away rights. Also funded by soros, the cherry on top of the shit sundae. That or that he's a fucking moron who isn't going to have a high school degree.  (did he actually follow through with his "im nut gon go to skewl until they a gun banz")Tool. Tool of the msm. They will use him until he is done. Hollywood dose the same when it comes to children. May be so, but more importantly, he is being used as a tool.  The left is using kids to push an emotionally driven anti gun agenda.  Do not underestimate this scrawny soyboy Exactly. Unfortunately he's going to keep saying asinine shit as long as he continues to get attention.If he's gone, we don't know who's going to be there to replace him. We've hit a goldmine with this retard.I saw a video on snap of him the other day and during the interview his alarm went off on his phone. He told the interviewer that he has an alarm that goes off every 10 minutes to remind him to tweet a company that supports the NRA and ask them why they support them and when they're gonna stop. It gave me a cringe seizure.But now are laughing at what complete idiots he and his handlers are with every word that comes out of his little butthole mouth.Why doesn’t the gay community just let go of the term fag? You all demand we don’t use it but then get mad when we use it for something other than gays People have been calling people fags and faggots for a long to mean someone who is stupid, wimpy, weak minded etc for a long time. When someone calls someone who is gay a faggot it’s more obvious. This kid is just a troll. The anti-conservatives eat it up. Horrible spelling, logical fallacies, hypocrisy, sense of entitlement, thinks tv shows make him educated. Exactly.

It is a legitimate-government function in a neutral way in a pretty non-intrusive fashion. Just because he won’t be able hide his Rule 34 hentai porn from everyone anymore doesn’t make it unconstitutional. You’d think they be fine with the same logic that suspends the 2nd amendment on school property would apply to the fourth. Sad thing is they functionally killed the 4th amendment a long time ago, it's barely more than words on paper at this point.Constitutional rights don't really apply in school to begin with (hence the fact that it is a gun free zone and there is no free speech) Nor that if they did institute it as a safety measure, the school would almost surely win.

Typical liberal, they want to give money to "poor people" but they don't want to be the one to pay for it.

XOXO-Kid in PictureDavid Hogg says David Hogg shouldn't have to fear packing his school bag for an overnight and having other people see his dildo.This guy talks about REVOLUTION. And then cries about a clear backpack? Go back to the kiddie table and play with your crayons. Yes, but the majority of transgender people are liberals. And a main belief in liberalism is that there are more than two genders, and maybe 1 conservative believes that.I sexually Identify as an Attack Helicopter. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of soaring over the oilfields dropping hot sticky loads on disgusting foreigners. People say to me that a person being a helicopter is Impossible and I’m fucking retarded but I don’t care, I’m beautiful. I’m having a plastic surgeon install rotary blades, 30 mm cannons and AMG-114 Hellfire missiles on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me “Apache” and respect my right to kill from above and kill needlessly. If you can’t accept me you’re a heliphobe and need to check your vehicle privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.Just implement Dick Morris' suggestion: metal detector school gates. It's cost efficient and is free from logistical silliness.School's don't have money to provide that for all the kids. That's why they hand out those lists at the beginning of the year.The schools don't have to provide them, kids bring their own at the beginning of the year and they leave them in the classroom instead of taking them home everyday. Or they could simply have a bag or binder that stays in a locker which holds materials like scissors and compasses so they have them during the day if needed. But honestly those things are rarely used anyway, pencil and paper was 95% of what you needed throughout most of my school days.The security guard can do a check on the spot if the sensor starts beeping.

He wants to infringe on our 2A right, but is upset when his rights gets infringed. Go eat a dick, fuckface.What's funny is that the real solution is a return to traditionalism, where boys have a sense of purpose and meaning and don't want to shoot people up. But that goes against all the gynocentric social engineering, so we're going to ban everything instead.What's funny is that the real solution is a return to traditionalism, where boys have a sense of purpose and meaning and don't want to shoot people up.

The CIA failed, the mental health system failed, the cowardly school security failed, the policy of 'gun-free zones' made the school an open target, yet it's the fault of the guns? Mentally-deranged people don't follow laws. If it's not an AR-15, then it's a semi-truck, or explosive.Also, clear backpacks implicates the 4th Amendment not the 1st Amendment. Maybe he should actually go to class and try to learn some history (particularly the American Revolution), instead of skipping to be a puppet for the gun confiscation movement.These kids are like the douchebags at the science fair who’s parents did all the work for them.  Except in this case the parents are George Soros.Welcome to the DNC kid.  You gave them an inch and they are taking a mile.  Get used to it or grow up and think for yourself.  Stop letting people put words in your mouth.Anyone want to discuss clear backpacks? I think it would be a good idea to have clear bags and it would be a school uniform. Everyone should have the standard books, pencils, pens, etc in their so it's not like it is a invasion of privacy. It would even help with drugs and school security. Plus it would save me 50 bucks trying to buy a "cool name brand backpack".Right to privacy and protection from unwarranted searches. He is correct. Maybe he should reread that bill of rights to see what the other numbers say.This guy's head is just a guitar pick strum'n the false tune of globalism. Literally...his head is a guitar pick.Oh, NOW he cares about constitutional rights!!  How convenient!  Yeah, how does it feel to pay for something someone else did? I hope everyone at school are blaming him.  I would have said "his friends" but I don't think he has any.He’s skipping school to go on these protest speeches as well. He said he skipped a math test and his teachers are very understanding.  The fallout at the end of the school year will be interesting. If he’s being given preferential treatment by the school and the ability to choose when and where he tests but the other children are not, that’s a big problem. If he’s failing them, which he should be bc he’s truant, that’s going to effect his status.  Either way this kid is torching his future publicly and it’s amazing to watch. His parents must really hate his guts to encourage this. I hope everyone at school are blaming him.

Now they can stop the next student that tries to sneak into the school undetected while using their bag to conceal Tide podsAm I the only one that thinks this kid is the next anointed Marxist goon along the lines of how the globalists plucked Obama out of nowhere and groomed his entire life to lead the Marxist march to the White House? This kid pops up everywhere. I just pray he’s not the “leader” of some new 60’s flower power generation that would put the final nail in the US coffin. Uniforms and codes on piercings, tattoos, makeup, hats, shoes, phones, slurred speech. That's a start to ending violence.Rowdy kids get handcuffed in another room for 8 hours with a bag on their head so they can't spit at people.I saw somewhere today that he was fast paced into the spotlight  no..... he was placed in front of the camera by his FBI dad that was owed a favor by a CNN reporter.I'm gonna throw on my tinfoil hat for a minute and say that this all feels very contrived. As in this whole clear backpacks 'scandal' was planned and discussed between a few of these actors; the local gov, the police, the camera Hoggs and co., whoever is funding them. The local gov passes clear backpack law, leftists Ree and claim unconstitutional, essentially laughing and spitting in everyone's faces about their attack on our 2A (in typical leftist fashion, I.E hypocritical, rules for thee and not for me) Correct me if I am wrong, but do any school shooters go to a few classes the day they decide to they decided to massacre their fellow pupils. I guess they just turn up and start shooting.Please, don't try to make sense of this. None of this makes sense. This is not how this works, this is not how any of this works.This plus his Hitler salute he did today at the March is just embarrassing. They are not sending their best folks. Believe me. This will be an easy fight...we must unite and go to the polls. I will be taking my family of 300 to the polls come November and we will vote!It's funny because these are the same people who don't care about the government spying on them because, "I'm not doing anything wrong, I have nothing to hide." Well then when you extend that logic to clear backpacks, you shouldn't care because you have nothing to hide right?When I was in high school (a decade or so ago ), some fuckwit figured out that if they made a bomb threat that the school would have to be evacuated and classes would be effectively canceled for the day. We had metal detectors at the front entrance of the school, clear backpacks, chaperoned bathroom visits, etc. There's no Constitutional right to a backpack. I understand that this kid just experienced a really life-altering trauma and is in shock, but that doesn't mean his feelings and opinions should be broadcast on national news networks and he should be flying around the country giving interviews. This is ridiculous. Good, that little weak-chinned commie deserves what happened. Hell they should impose a school uniform and lock the doors like Lean On Me. He wants to impose restrictions on others, let him have a taste of it.Clear backpacks or any of that won't work. The Florida shooter was not allowed to wear a backpack to school and that didn't stop himI agree with you here. The irony though is that he is arguing against infringing on constitutional rights while also pushing for gun control that others would argue infringe on constitutional rights. These ones get more retarded and illogical by the minute; "YOU KNOW WHATS GONNA PREVENT SOMEONE SHOOTING US? CLEAR BACKPACKS!"A year or two from now people are going to look back at his comments and his interviews and wonder how they missed all the warning signs.What's the consensus here on clear backpacks? I already know David Hogg is a fucking moron because he's trying to protect one constitutional right while trying to destroy another, but I'm curious about the backpacks. When I was in school if I had something I didn't want people seeing, chances are I wouldn't have it just randomly placed in the backpack anyway, it'd likely just be an obscene drawing in a sketchbook or a folder and that's it. Clear backpacks means once less place to conceal items you shouldn't have, not just with guns but other things too. If it doesn't stop a kid wanting to tote a gun into the school, at least it makes them have to be more creative, and it's better than getting accused of having a gun in your backpack then having somebody come and search.We can joke all we want, but the ATF is banning bump stocks because of calls to action from losers like this, and politicians going turn coat on their promises to support the 2A. It's funny because the idiot still hasn't put 2 and 2 together, they will keep pushing and more shit will be taken from them and they will keep pushing til there is nothing left to take.The sheer magnitude of cuck buildup fuses into heavier elements magnified by the gravitational force exerted by his testicles and must be disposed of in a radioisotope sarcophagus.The sheer magnitude of cuck buildup fuses into heavier elements magnified by the gravitational force exerted by his testicles and must be disposed of in a radioisotope sarcophagus.The sheer magnitude of cuck buildup fuses into heavier elements magnified by the gravitational force exerted by his testicles and must be disposed of in a radioisotope sarcophagus.The sheer magnitude of cuck buildup fuses into heavier elements magnified by the gravitational force exerted by his testicles and must be disposed of in a radioisotope sarcophagus.And then they accuse the people on the "altright"(anything that means not far left) of being violent and instigating violence by showing up with helmets and shields.I wonder where they got the ridiculous idea that they needed to protect their heads, and "how dare you call Antifa violent and just as responsible for riots"And then they accuse the people on the "altright"(anything that means not far left) of being violent and instigating violence by showing up with helmets and shields.I wonder where they got the ridiculous idea that they needed to protect their heads, and "how dare you call Antifa violent and just as responsible for riots"That’s savage. The brainwashed zombies probably either didn’t read the whole thing or didn’t understand it.  This looks very much like the work of Protest Warrior. I used to dig their shit back in the 00’s when I first got red pilled. Wonder if they’re still kickin’.They've been inactive for a long time it seems.

We have politicians in office who are illegals and open the state they want to bring more illegals.

Absolutely nothing. And this is why our government is full of traitors. Because there are no repercussions. Now maybe taking their door in dragging them out throwing a rope around their neck and tying the other end to a sturdy branch might be a little much, personally I think it fits just fine, Others May disagree.

For every Centipede a coat, for every coat a Centipede!I'm no doctor, but I diagnose that patriot with a case of testicular elephantiasis, but I've never seen anyone with balls that big before.Funny how an organization with the word "parenthood" in its name is better at killing than an organization with "rifle" in its name.MOTHER FUCKER...   the last three hours I have been watching these protests.. having a brain aneurysm  .IF ANY OF THESE PEOPLE CARED ABOUT THE CHILDREN THEY WOULD BE OUTSIDE THE PARKLAND SHERIFF OFFICE DEMANDING THE RESIGNATIONS OF THE OFFICERS THAT STOOD OUTSIDE 6+ MINUTES UNTIL THE GUNFIRE WAS OVER......Yep, people who contribute nothing to society except walking around whining about shit instead of doing something, like working.Yep, people who contribute nothing to society except walking around whining about shit instead of doing something, like working.So are people against planned parenthood against birth control....??????? Cuz they helpful providers of the pull and stuff. Everything they do is counted as an individual service.  If you're going for an abortion and they take your weight and height, that's a service.  If they draw blood, that's a service.  If they do a pregnancy test, that's a service.   So even  if you go in there for the sole purpose of having an abortion, you may have a list of 10+ services administered to you.Everything they do is counted as an individual service.

A fetus that screams while being dismembered and torn apart is not an embryo. It's alive. Also, if it dies as a result of assault or violence to the mother, it's considered murder. Go choke yourself you subhuman piece of trash.Oh boohoo:( you dumb fucks want to get rid of Planned Parenthood so bad when it’s the very organization preventing them. You think making abortions illegal is going to stop them altogether? No bitch, it’s just going to bring back life threatening illegal abortions. Go back to crying in your corner.Lol what a sad response. Care to elaborate? No? Didn’t think so. Find someone who can actually argue your side for me.Fuck off.

If you think protecting babies and protecting teenagers are of unequal importance, you may be part of the problem.Look if you can point to other methods of murder that these nitwits are protesting in DC about, then by all means do it. Otherwise you're wrong. This is a gun grabbers wet dream. Young people being used as puppets to get retards to vote to take their rights away. And like seals, liberals will clap in approval. The NRA has a program to protect schools that any school district can take advantage of at no cost to the school district.  The NRA founded the national instant background check system in use today, and vigorously encourages enforcement of existing laws (e.g.38 out of 50 states report fewer than 80% of prohibited gun possessors to the background check system)Planned Parenthood also offers preventative measures against pregnancy. However, they get $500M in taxpayer dollars per year to do so. The NRA is funded 95% by its members and 5% through gun manufacturers.The difference between the NRA and Planned Parenthood: One sells arms, the other defends the Second Amendment.I'm sorry mate but I totally diagree.  They're two seperate issues to me and you're going to have to accept that other people have different opinions than you. Sure, every issue is a separate issue. The point, however, is that the true concern isn't with saving lives. I would agree with you that using such a controversial subject as abortion isn't the best approach but it is relevant. Let's use something less controversial though to better drive home the point. If the goal was really to save lives there are quite literally hundreds, probably thousands, of more effective ways to do so. So why pick on guns? Well, because the goal isn't to save lives it is to disarm the populace so that the government can do whatever they want without fear. The people, mostly kids, who are actually concerned with saving lives are merely being used by their intellectual betters to further an agenda.I agreed with a lot of what your said until the conspiracy theory that the government wants to disarm the population so they can rule us without fear. They do that already, man. They don't need to take away our guns to take away our rights. But yes I agree that abortion is not the issue and is a ridiculous example to make a point about gun control. Not by default, but in this case yeah these protesters' opinion is indeed wrong. It's rooted in hypocrisy and illegality. Marching to take away their rights... Fuckin' A.Look, you'd be surprised how open to discussion we are here. Guns kill people. Good people and bad people.Look if you can point to other methods of murder that these nitwits are protesting in DC about, then by all means do it. Otherwise you're wrong.

They will believe anything the media tells them, and it’s usually just the headline.Useful idiots are the first ones executed. They don’t understand their ignorance and stupidity are used as tools.They certainly won't be able to protect themselves. Bubba don't give a shit about restrictions. Bubba innawoods.Also all the students doing these walk outs ( that were actually class assignments) were voluntarily herded like cattle. Well, some smart ones stayed behind, or didn’t like it at all and thought it was the dumbest thing ever. I feel worse for those. This is what the left does. They always say one thing and do the exact opposite. It's a weird tactic that must have worked for them for a long time. When I think "herded like cattle" I think the jews of the holocaust having their rights stripped and being abused by a tyrannical government. this is what happens when you choke on the shit someone else gave you to spew.  that speech was so obviously scripted that she could barely say the words and that was before she gave herself a shit shower.I think I need like 15 double cream double soy Crappuchinos to calm my genetics after that much literal shaking...I think I need like 15 double cream double soy Crappuchinos to calm my genetics after that much literal shaking...I think I need like 15 double cream double soy Crappuchinos to calm my genetics after that much literal shaking...That’s literally what they are.

I was going to do a FTFY-joke with "literal" and "liberal" vomit, but within this context it's literally (liberally?) the same.This is our talking point. That they didn't understand what the hell she was ranting about until she summed it up by vomiting. Cue applause.I was going to do a FTFY-joke with "literal" and "liberal" vomit, but within this context it's literally (liberally?) the same.I was going to do a FTFY-joke with "literal" and "liberal" vomit, but within this context it's literally (liberally?) the same.Side effects may include: making an ass out of yourself, vomiting on live TV, blaming the world for your failures, and voting for globalist Soros puppets.There is truth to this statement.  She is really full of toxic negativity, and your body only knows one way to get rid of something toxic from your body. This is a massive swarm of young girls that are leading the downfall of civilization by advocating for tyranny by screaching and crying about empathy. We can't let them get away with this. There isn't a logical brain cell in that crowd; it's all pure emotion. They think that taking away American's right to bare arms will stop violence in a country with rapidly changing demographics, democrat control of nearly all cities, and a south african style (EFF) change in the democrat party. They think that disarming republicans will stop democrats, who form the overwhelming majority of gun crime, from killing people. This is sickening to watch. You can't strip honest hardworking people of their civil rights in order to stop degenerates from slaughtering people on the streets of American cities. The democrat party is entirely ruled by unstable emotional women, the soy boy pussies that want to get "close" to them, and their votes. We're watching the downfall of Western Civilization. Without the United States, the West is absolutely positively doomed. Can you imagine what the tail end of the 21st century will be like without the United States? We're going to end up on islands of sanity surrounded by marxist witches that want to give away the wealth that was built by strong men in centuries past to people that want us dead. The last thing we have to defend ourselves from that kind of future is the 2nd amendment. If we ever lose that right, we are finished. It has to be in apocalyptic terms. If we lose the 2nd amendment, our civilization is gone.We want to pat ourselves on the back for being so 'progressive' but what have the results been over the last 50+ years?Totally. I tried to find who said/wrote the below but apparently the original citation has been lost. I think it says a lot about where we’ll end up if we continue to allow to vote people who own nothing and pay no taxes, as unpopular as that sounds.“A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the majority discovers it can vote itself largess out of the public treasury. After that, the majority always votes for the candidate promising the most benefits with the result the democracy collapses because of the loose fiscal policy ensuing, always to be followed by a dictatorship, then a monarchy.”Any sane woman should be against the 19th Amendment as they know as a sane woman they are in the minority of all women. They know better than men do that women are fucking nuts. It's a joke our politics has to cater to these emotional blobs.  Tell me truthfully.  Do you believe the majority of women make decisions rationally and logically?  If you think they do, why are men always confused about women and how they think?Whenever leftist women in power positions or influence screech 'our voice' I think of movements like Temperance, voting suffrage, entering workplace in droves through 70s and 80s. Now, fabricating a gender crisis is all they have for continued power shifting, cause that is all it is at this point.Have women apologized for Prohibition? It was their baby. And yet the worst set of laws ever passed. All that shrill arrogance, hubris, and yet, no apology. Prohibition is what happens when you think with your emotions. Which when you think about it, isn't really thinking. It is just being emotional. Certain powers that be want to see a large part of the human race wiped out and the survivors (500 million georgia guidestones) to be dumbed down enough that they can just be used as entertainment and food (yes, cannibalism) for the 'elites'.The 'elite' race of people in this short story remind me very much of what the 'decadent' elites current are wanting. All the way up to using humans as entertainment toys and total degeneracy.Even that number seems high as that would still be an enormous amount of people to try to control, unfortunately the Elite over the past 2000 years have honed their skills masterfully.  Especially in the end when it will be controlled with a counterfeit Christ indwelt with the spirit of Lucifer. What amuses me though is why most of these guys sell us out to them, they’ll be the first group killed when these guys take real control.  Gee, I wonder who could be behind this? If I were to take a wild guess....I'd say it's a group who has literally undermined (through subversive commie actions) every single country they've ever inhabited.It’s downright disturbing to think about. I never thought I’d be a Doomsday prepper, but it’s likely I’ll pick up that “hobby” one day.I don't see how his channel will make it to December. Google is going to have to shut that down. The truth is in direct opposition to the left; the truth can not be uttered.   Yeah,i don't trust the democrats,if and when it reacts the point where whites become a minority does anyone here seriously believe the democrats will give whites all the benefits that they give to minorities?No,they won't,hell these people don't even give a shit about the white south Africans that are getting killed,what makes you think they'll care about whites here?You can't strip honest hardworking people of their civil rights in order to stop degenerates from slaughtering people on the streets of American cities. I don't like these giant marches on Washington. We have families and it's just dangerous and sickening. I think we should all go to our own states' or cities' center of government on Saturdays or Sundays at the same time, and show our support that way. Just calmly show up.After watching the unhinged left for the past year and a half, why would anyone want to disarm themselves ??Side effects may include: making an ass out of yourself, vomiting on live TV, blaming the world for your failures, and voting for globalist Soros puppets.There is truth to this statement.

This truly is the march of the Virtue Signallers. What they are putting these kids through is really screwed up. They aren't even old enough to drop out of highschool, let alone buy a gun; actual adults are using them at their own expense. This is sick.   Come meet George Clooney, sell your country out, it'll be nice, we'll have a few laughs, you'll stress vomit. WOOOOThe Left has always used kids to promote their political agenda; the fascists did it, the communists do it, and the Left in this country is no exception. You can always find kids at any leftist rally or march.Exactly. I can't bring my kids to church on Sunday because it's "brainwashing", but this is perfectly fine. Double standards?If not for double standards they would have no standards at all. Leftists are the epitome of hypocrisy and cognative dissonance.meanwhile you're supposed to let the kids get 'culturally enriched' by kebabs from the mideast and drag queens and women who chop off their breasts and get addicted to testosterone.Meanwhile, they have their proverbial cake and eat it too by killing off their kids with abortions and bringing in third world criminals.Meanwhile I live in the country and teach my child how to build things, play sports, hunt, fish etc. Basically basic life lessons on how to grow up and be a man. The parents that put their kids into these things all want them sweet, sweet facebook likes to show their virtue...Glad to know there are still patriots out there raising their kids right. I pity these kids with lefty parents.You'll stay up all night practicing your lines so by the time you deliver them, your eyes will be droopier than George soros'sIs that how his eyes got that way I wonder? Apologizing for all those Nazis killing his own people when he was a teenager.Also, he didn't apologize for helping the Nazis. He said he doesn't regret helping them round up Jews and confiscate their property because "They were already having their property taken away. If I didn't do it, someone else would have done it instead."All I can think of is how retarded my politics and decisions were at 16-18. If I traveled back in time I wouldn't even listen to myself LOLThey operate on feels only, which is why they are so easily manipulated. Not much critical thinking going on there in that crowd.I can't echo this sentiment enough. EVERY SINGLE CONVERSATION I have had with someone supporting this movement has no awareness of the facts, history, or other factors that are much larger determinents of school shootings. Their ignorance is TOTAL.The kids are, but the adults are just as easily manipulated because they have abandoned reason and critical thought for feelings and groupthink. Most of these people are so far gone that you could get them to support almost anything using propaganda and social media. It should scare the shit out everyone.Hope the next generation after them rises up and mercilessly fix this current bunch of screeching snowflakes.Kyle scares me a little bit (in a good way).  He's got zero fear!  It's like he's a machine, without emotions.  Nothin but logic-bombs all day long.On preliminary evidence, Gen Z is hardcore far right, the fun begins with them. Hope I'll live long enough to witness it.Typical Gen X profile:
Born: 1966-1976
Coming of Age: 1988-1994
Age in 2014: 38 to 48
Current Population: 41 millionSometimes referred to as the “lost” generation, this was the first
generation of “latchkey” kids, exposed to lots of daycare and divorce. Known
as the generation with the lowest voting participation rate of any generation,
Gen Xers were quoted by Newsweek as “the generation that dropped out without
ever turning on the news or tuning in to the social issues around them.”Gen X is often characterized by high levels of skepticism, “what’s in it for
me” attitudes and a reputation for some of the worst music to ever gain
popularity. Now, moving into adulthood William Morrow (Generations) cited the
childhood divorce of many Gen Xers as “one of the most decisive experiences
influencing how Gen Xers will shape their own families”.Gen Xers are arguably the best educated generation with 29% obtaining a
bachelor’s degree or higher (6% higher than the previous cohort). And, with
that education and a growing maturity they are starting to form families with a
higher level of caution and pragmatism than their parents demonstrated. Concerns
run high over avoiding broken homes, kids growing up without a parent around and
financial planning.I have a bit of Gen Y in me, because I was around young enough to learn/grow with the interwebs. starting for me with mIRC, ICQ, MSN Messenger etc.. She could have held a puppy up and gutted it it right there on stage while it was screaming and alive and they still would applaud.Is it wrong that I laughed at her?  Maybe a little public humiliation will help her think a little harder about what stupid thing she’s bought into.  it really is just by the look of every one of them, poor young, manipulated kids being actively brainwashed to unarm  and protect themselves meanwhile if this were some pro-life rally and a high school speaker threw up they would be laughing about it and shitting on the speaker.That speech was so scripted it isn't even funny. Not one damn word she said was her words. Fucking brainwashed idiots. I agree what she said was all bull, but her face did get fucked up from the shooter and I don't see how her getting sick and nervous is something to make fun of really, we are better than that. Still funny tho What they are putting these kids through is really screwed up. They aren't even old enough to drop out of highschool, let alone buy a gun; actual adults are using them at their own expense. This is sick.   Come meet George Clooney, sell your country out, it'll be nice, we'll have a few laughs, you'll stress vomit. WOOOOThe Left has always used kids to promote their political agenda; the fascists did it, the communists do it, and the Left in this country is no exception.

These people are zombies. Sooooo fucking weird. The mind wash is real. And this whole thing looking like it's a Democratic Think Tank project....Allow for shooting in heavily Democrat district with a sheriff that cares more about his public image than safety..Start nation wide movement by cherry picking swamp employee's children to lead the conversation..Dismantle the Constitution 100% agree. Some of the students (Kyle Kashuv comes to mind) are even doing proper steps and informing others that it's not guns that are the issue, and even talking to legislators in the area about proper school reform. Notice those student are not even seen. Muh Gun Control Feels > anything. It's really shocking (it's not).While one school resource officer sleeps, and the other toodles around in a golf cart organizing other officers to stay outside and form a perimeter while the shooter inside walks around triple-shooting anyone that's still alive after the first pass.I was out and about today in the thick of one of these crowds, and all these progressives (literally every one) had some sort of sign and were holding it up displaying it to the person next to them, shouts something, then rotates to show it to another person with a similar sign.

Forget about "Muh Russians" and worry about the people who are actually making you believe you're taking part in something grassroots.Their claim that any of this was "grassroots" or created by the kids themselves is laughable. The local leftists here and our cucked local paper made the same claim, but I monitor them and their local political group on social media and kept screenshots of their conversations plotting to contact the schools and the kids to agitate them into marching. They started this the very moment the national walk out was announced. Grassroots my ass.The school administrators were involved too. At the middle school here they actually pulled a fire alarm to get all the kids outside the school for the anti-gun walkout.they (school administrators) actually pulled a fire alarm to get all the kids outside the school for the anti-gun walkout.I agree. Hopefully some parents here will take legal action against them. Our shill newspaper editor even tried to cover for the school by denying that it happened and calling the people who reported it on social media "conspiracy theorists". When he got called out on it and was forced to admit that the fire alarm was pulled, he then concocted some lame story about them pulling it to prevent the kids from leaving the school grounds, which makes no sense. The guy calls himself a journalist and then runs cover for corrupt school officials. Makes me sick.I don't know, but it sure is unethical at the very least, and I'm hoping some parents here take action. I don't have kids but I pay taxes and I'm planning on attending the next school board meeting to confront them about what they did.Their claim that any of this was "grassroots" or created by the kids themselves is laughable.

They're like the "This is good for bitcoin" meme.In a group that is all about feels, being physically overcome by your feels gives you instant cachet.

They're like the "This is good for bitcoin" meme.In a group that is all about feels, being physically overcome by your feels gives you instant cachet. These idiots say they're starting a new revolution... how can you do that when you're the ones who don't believe in the 2nd Amendment and think you're going to win against true Americans? technically, the youth vote is the only untapped power in politics. historically, kids never vote, they are too lazy or don't have a ride, etc..But, given the fact the MSM/Dems have revered and lauded over kids as victims that should be heard, they have created a monster base. This is the left-overs from the Bernie brats who want free everything and understand nothing..The MSM and Dems, they know if they can give these kids enough energy and attention, they WILL vote, then we actually have a problem. It all comes down to election day (mid-terms or otherwise).. do they show up, are they pissed enough, or will get enough attention that they are motivated to show up and actually vote. once that happens they open the gate for the Democrat Demons to take power and shove them aside for their BS Globalist agenda.. POLICE STATE, SINGLE CORPORATE WORLD GOVERNMENT AND A SINGLE WORLD BANK, CRUSHING THESE STUPID FUCKS UNDER THEIR ECONOMIC TANK TREADS  They’ve been trying to get kids to vote for thirty years. Thankfully kids don’t pay close attention to politics, especially midterm elections, and even if they do, they’re generally pretty lazy. That isn’t a criticism either. Kids have better things to worry about than voting. They should leave it up to the people who know their shit. Thats why literally everything is being politicized now. Music, movies, shows, ads. Conditioning the kids to take a side on issues They know nothing about other than what their favorite actors, singers and teachers tell them. It's a guerilla war waged on very impressionable youth. I have to agree, Dems learned if they can't get Americans to vote for them they will import people who will, why not also go after the sleeping youth.. they are easy to control emotionally and that is 99% of the fight..makes me wonder if the changes in national propaganda regulations obama made are now taking effect, and this is the result of that Exactly neither side has ever been able to capitalize getting teens to vote. Obama during his first election was the most successful but they wont be running an obama next time around.They tried this with Bernie, Hillary, Obama, etc. It's certainly something to keep an eye on, but most teenagers are still more concerned with their Instagram likes that the real world.Oh, and most of these CHILDREN are not legally able to vote anyway and we must fight to the death these stupid measures to lower the voting age below 18.They are counting on convincing our own government to start the revolution by violating the Constitution.technically, the youth vote is the only untapped power in politics. historically, kids never vote, they are too lazy or don't have a ride, etc..But, given the fact the MSM/Dems have revered and lauded over kids as victims that should be heard, they have created a monster base.

We are not against some child.  We are just glad to see flaws in a well orchestrated, leftist propaganda rally to deny rights.We ARE against the way leftists would disingenuously use children to advance their globalist agenda, and how these same leftists use tragedy to take away our freedoms.These kids are uninformed and manipulated (and thats sad, but understandable, they are just children after all).  The real villains are the adults who are using these children as propaganda tools for their own purposes.This is nothing new, leftists/socialists and tyrants have been using these sorts of ploys for decades.“The state must declare the child to be the most precious treasure of the people. As long as the government is perceived as working for the benefit of the children, the people will happily endure almost any curtailment of liberty and almost any deprivation.”Truer words were never spoken. Leftists lap up the "for the children" drivel like a dog laps up its own vomit. Wait....And the right laps up "for the military" just the same. One takes our freedoms, the other takes our wallet. And we clap and cheer and make excuses for them when they do it.Promote someone into a position of power and influence and then claim that person is immune from all criticism.The local leftists here in my town applied this tactic when countering the dissent here against them using the local school kids for their political agenda. Any criticism was framed as "attacking the children" and "attempting to silence them". They know exactly what they are doing by using these kids. Pure evil.Truer words were never spoken. Leftists lap up the "for the children" drivel like a dog laps up its own vomit. Wait....And the right laps up "for the military" just the same. One takes our freedoms, the other takes our wallet. And we clap and cheer and make excuses for them when they do it.Promote someone into a position of power and influence and then claim that person is immune from all criticism.thats exactly what i feel like doing when i think about how these uninformed leftists want to take away my rightsThat's the most over-emotionalized rant I've ever heard in my life. I get it. You had a bad experience. You're a victim but this level of and embracement of victimhood is entirely too much and sounds A LOT like someone looking for attention. Actually, she is just looking for attention. but the crazy part is that she offers a "solution" that (if you look into actual facts) will not only not solve the problem, but will make it worseThat's the thing though. Leftist solutions never fix the problem. Leftist solutions are usually entirely unrelated tangents away from the problem that almost always involve giving up rights and giving the government more and more power. That's the game they play. look at commie mao zedong in china when he tried his full retard full industrialization of china by forcing the farmers to leave the farms and bake ceramic pottery in personal kilns in their backyards instead. not only were the ceramics terrible quality and worthless and couldn't be used but they all starved to death.Millions of people have undured far worse than that little vomit queen, and she has much worse in store for her if she gets what she is advocating for. These people are completely ignorant of history and have abandoned critical thinking.Emotions over facts.  They literally try to make it as emotional as possible in order to justify ignoring all the factual evidence.That's the most over-emotionalized rant I've ever heard in my life. I get it.

Their style, intonation, and pacing are exactly the same.  It's almost as if there is some sort of deep... state... coordination lurking in the shadows that manipulates current events and people for monetary and societal gain.It's a style of speaking that has its roots in the southern black churches that spread out of the south during the great migration. Which has it's roots in African call and response style tribal music, likely the first music humans ever made. Which is why it is so effective as it speaks to us on an evolutionary level. Hogg's bald buddy is talking now.  She pulled a Jimmy Kimmel although he cries on command a lot quicker than she does.  She stood there for at least a minute conjuring up the tears.  Then as soon as she walks backstage she is all smiles.  Fucking tool.It's funny how noone is marching against the Broward Police Department given everything we know.  Something could actually be accomplished by doing that.Embarrassing. You would never see a pro life, pro gun, pro trump person puke like that on Nat TV. Her puke was protruding through her shirt. Nasty woman.I'm ashamed of this girl. The level of victimhood that she's trying to achieve here just sounds like a desperate attention whore. There are men and women that are only a few years older than her that are in Iraq and Afghanistan killing bad guys and engaging in fire fights and then laughing about it at the DFAC a few hours later. She needs to get off the Cross because the rest of us need the wood. I'm ashamed of this girl. The level of victimhood that she's trying to achieve here just sounds like a desperate attention whore.

Arguing about political issues is one thing, enjoying a girl getting emotional over dead children is another. How does this bring you joy? Go ahead and ban me you fucking snowflakes, you people are truly sad, and I pity you.These morons think OUR RIGHTS are a political issue and that we should just stand back and allow our rights to be taken away from us. Meanwhile, this "child" doesn't even have the courage to give a speech without vomiting and looking like a fool. I think the scary thing,...is the possibility that they could be successful in legislating away our rights as we sit back here on Reddit while they're out in force marching in the streets without oppositionThis entire movement is emotional masturbation...what's important is that we show up to the polls in the mid-terms...prevent the Dems from taking back the house...clean out the republicucks...and prevent this fucking cancer from metastasizing.These leftist agitators and useful idiots assume that they will be immune from the consequences of what they advocate for.

We have a Trump 2016 and American Flag hanging off our balcony. Trump flag was taken down this morning around 6. These people are fucking psychos But national policy is build from rational discourse and tempered by the control of temper, not the embrace of it. It's why we have justice, and not vengeance. And why I am not moved to action by an argument founded on "I feel ___"Why is everything so emotional??? Get up there with a chart or a slideshow with facts showing me exactly how gun control will solve the problem, and I'll listen. (Answer: it won't solve the problem.)That's why they can't show any facts. They have to rely on emotions because the facts won't back up their argument. When you can't go off facts, you throw a tissy fit of emotion. Some people react to emotion more than fact and those people heard in like cattle to watch each other cryyeah....show how mao zedong took the guns away from chinese civilians and see how that 'saved lives'.That's why they can't show any facts. They have to rely on emotions because the facts won't back up their argument. The crying and puking on stage doesnt make you want to shit your pants in fear of the coming revolution?Awww isn’t it funny how black children getting slaughtered in gun free zones in gun free cities for decades doesn’t matter, but a couple rich white kids in a wealthy democratic country die, let’s change all the laws! Maybe your gun laws won’t save lives, maybe we already know that, just gotta get out of that suburban bubble is all She was so nervous because they probably gave her that speech that morning and told her to act tough.  Probably showed her a passionate speech and told her to mimic it.  Lol and then tries to play it like she's cool for doing it lol, I can't even handle this, these are these weak morons demanding my gun hahahabbahahababaHere's what you do be like "okay children if you want to act like that we will ban everything from you that has a chance to kill you so we're going to ban cars we're going to ban cell phones for anyone under 25" once you hit cell phones they be like no it's cool we can keep the guns.Yeah, I totally get the feeling of anger when the majority is punished for the faults of a few. Sounds like gun control, eh? Now think about  gun control laws advocated by the same idiots. Stupid and annoying? Try unconstitutional and tyrannical.Yeah, I totally get the feeling of anger when the majority is punished for the faults of a few. Sounds like gun control, eh?

Working on getting gun rights back from a mistake I made almost 20 years ago. Who's doing the speech coaching for these kids? Has anyone noticed they ALL talk exactly like Michelle Obama? The same cadence, the same inflection, the same head shaking, the hand gestures, the same emotionally overwrought, vaguely poetic rhetoric that is NOT rooted in hard facts. This girl sounds like a sped-up version of Mrs Obama. And Mrs Obama sounds like a more intense, resentful version of her husband.This oratorical style is like a quasi-sermon from a black Baptist preacher except there's way more anger, resentment and self-righteousness. And way less joy and gratitude.But there is one preacher who's got the rage, the bitterness and aims for the same intense call to some sort of 'revolution'.Michelle Obama and all these kids all sound like they graduated from the Jeremiah Wright School Of Oratory.I missed the part in history class where, as an American citizen, we receive the God-given right to peace of mind. People just shouldn't be in danger of losing their life in a tragic situation at any point in time because of how much it would suck to see that kind of thing happen. Life is supposed to be this 24/7 party where the brain only experiences the good and happy emotions. Get them bad feels out of here, it's not like we need them to establish perspective on why good things are good or any nonsense like that. Free basic income and college tuition for all. Bernie 2020! /sUgh. Now watch the spin as they will capitalize on this as if she is so heroic that her vitriol brought her to vomitting. That's how sick and disgusting she finds this whole situation etc. I can already hear the cheering. Remember pedes, this movement is not interested in facts and statistics, they ONLY WANT TO DISARM YOU. This is the only way they can impose their SJW flavor of Marxism. Which will be controlled by globalist elites. None of this is gonna do jack shit. Youre not getting peoples guns. The government failed in multiple instances of doing their job.I didn't know they were having the Kids Choice Awards in DC . Where's the part where they get slimed ? How about we just stop public school all together.  We homeschool.  It really is awesome.  I mean after all if I don't pay my property taxes, men with guns show up and throw me out of my house at gunpoint.... And that's what pays for schools.  Ironic twist to socialism, which public school is... Karl Marx wrote about it.I guess that pre-written speech they handed her didn't go down as smooth as she thought it would?  Holy shit.don't forget hes a follower of Saul Motherfucking Alinksy.  The most evil fucker since Lenin.  Dude dedicated his book, Rules for Radicals, to satan.Crooked Hillary wrote her senior thesis on Alinsky/Rules For Radicals (and corresponded with Alinsky also.) The true irony of it all. You need guns to take the guns. You'll create death to prevent death. Such foolishness But they’d have a much easier time leading us to the 30,000 guillotines Barry ordered if we had no guns. don't forget hes a follower of Saul Motherfucking Alinksy.

Pretty sure Pulse nightclub, San Bernardino, Fort Hood, Sandy Hook and Aurora, Colorado all happened under Mr. Soetoro’s administration.You haven’t seen your ‘wife’ in months. You are currently shilling some globalist bullshit in Australia and we want you to fuck off - probably on your way to Bali for some ‘relaxation.’No surprise that a traitor like Obama would have such little respect for the constitution. However, he did get one thing right:  Millions of voices are calling for you to be in jail (or worse), Obama, so I guess you're right in that respect.  Don't underestimate the power of Obama. He's going to be around a long time, is much younger than Donald Trump, and he's very popular among the uninformed. Don't underestimate the power of Obama. He's going to be around a long time, is much younger than Donald Trump, and he's very popular among the uninformed. Of course he's happy, this wasn't the plan, but he's glad the useful idiots are still willing to ask 'how high?' when required to jump. If the school didn't suppress the crimes the shooter actually committed in school earlier he would not have been able to purchase a gun. This is communist as shit. Looks like sunshine and farts on the outside but really what this tweet says is "don't stop until the job is done" Does anyone really believe that this is some sort of grass roots “movement” funded and led by children?Mother fucker was droning children, weaponized the DOj, irs and FBI, tried to rig an election and then remove a sitting president and he's confused why people won't give up their guns. I agree. Obama did so much damage to this country. We are in shambles and President Trump is going to pick up the pieces and put us back together again. Enough is enough!I agree. Obama did so much damage to this country. We are in shambles and President Trump is going to pick up the pieces and put us back together again. Enough is enough!I was once completly neutral on obama. When I used to just watch the MSM and their spin without ever questioning the "news" obama seemed smart & educated. But then I saw the light and really started to pay attention to what he was saying & trying to accomplish. I wish more people knew just how much he & his husband hated the country. The media napped for 8 years while this left wing radical had free reign to piss on the constitution, the country & America. FUCK OBAMA!Unless it's the gov't in front of a disarmed populace. Then millions of voices end up in big mass graves.Sounds like a former president is calling for changing not only the Constitution, but the original Bill of Rights. Sounds like a former president is calling for changing not only the Constitution, but the original Bill of Rights. Motherfucking constitution and the motherfucking conservatives who are going to be running that bitch He wants the citizenry to disarm so all his globalist dreams come true. Next his cronies will take away free speech as they have been trying to do. This allows him and those who pay him to accomplish population replacement (slave labor wages for immigrant workers) without a civil war. The oligarchs get richer.Marching to take individual rights away from themselves. That seems like something any politician from Chicago would wantI'm still trying to figure out why the residents of Cook county aren't marching on the mayor's office and dragging them all out by thier feet. I have a personal good friend they have hired with tax dollars to figure out how to make them all understand that they want the sugar tax. It's pure propaganda and manipulation to keep the funds going. A tax to go along with the toll roads mostly funded by the federal government which is a fun trick to tax the poor without admitting to it.I'm still trying to figure out why the residents of Cook county aren't marching on the mayor's office and dragging them all out by thier feet.

But that's all rhis idiot can ever offer. Vaguely worded support for "change".Ha. That's where you're wrong. Just like you were wrong about that magic fucking wand bringing jobs backGreat another anti American comment by this Muslim, just please go away Obama. The American people don't want your "change". This asshole has been 'inspired' so many people times, and all that inspiration motivated him to accomplish jack shit.and are we just going to ignore how many he killed with drones? (plenty of it justified, but hypocritical to act like a pacifist after that)If you control the media obuttfuck, yes you can. You and your shitfaced cronies have been silencing conservative cures since you had taken office.  Obama believed disciplining kids was racist since blacks kids got in more trouble.  He issued guidance to stop disciplining kids.Another reason and another reminder why we must never ever allow Progressive Democrats or Progressive Republicans to rule over us again. They are dangerous they are short sighted and they are corrupt. Remember we won they lost let's keep it that way in 2018!Obama believed disciplining kids was racist since blacks kids got in more trouble.

They care about YOUR private right to own a gun.Funny how the anti gun march in Chicago was in a nice upscale area which never experiences any gun violence, not the south or west side where several dozen people get shot every single weekend. Why aren’t they pleading their case to those fine folks??Exactly, don't even give their "position" the light of day. The only evidence on gun control proves that it does nothing to stop violent crime, even violent gun crime, in fact many times it's the total opposite. Call them out for what they are, people that want to TAKE YOUR GUNS! Once you're disarmed, they and their commie cohorts can point their loaded guns at you to make you bend the knee.Funny how the anti gun march in Chicago was in a nice upscale area which never experiences any gun violence, not the south or west side where several dozen people get shot every single weekend.

And then let's see how funny that evil shit is.I don't often wish death on people but when you can think it's okay, Hell not just okay, but a good thing that an innocent woman was murdered and that her self-confessed killer went free, you are just pure evil. There is no redeeming you, there is no discussion to be had. the faster you are off this planet the better the entire world will be I honestly don't see enemies/Communists as human. It's Us vs. Them. I don't become emotional and try to understand why they're evil.

On every block surrounding the event there were hundreds of homeless, street thugs and absolute trash. Then you get to the Shinny city center, that's protected by constant security keeping the riff raff out. City Hall is an Island in the middle of a sea of diarrhea. In just 2 blocks leading up to the event I saw 2 homeless smoking their crack, pigeons feasting on piles of puke and one massive shit that had probably been on the street judging by the mold for at least a week. Homeless surround the City center in SF, they live in over turned trash cans, set up tents  and do there business in between cars, on the walls, you really have to watch your step. I cant believe parents brought their children down there, if your not paying attention next thing you know Johnny could have a needle hanging out of his toe or stuck some other god awful thing in his mouth. I had to laugh reading this. I listen to Michael Savage and it's obvious what he says about San Fran Sicko is true..Savage doesn't know the half of it. He comes in from Marin to go to North beach. Its pretty tame over there comparatively. I had to laugh reading this. I listen to Michael Savage and it's obvious what he says about San Fran Sicko is true..Savage doesn't know the half of it.

Like drones. Or zombies. So malleable. Easy to buy... All you need to do is get a background check, local LEO signoff, full fingerprints, pay for the special NFA tax, fill out and fille all the proper forms, pay for your suppressor(s)... And then wait for about a year. Easy peasy!!Wait a second.. are you telling me I have to go through all that BS, background checks, fingerprints, fill out paperwork and get a license and THEN wait a year while they are probably running more background checks and reading my emails while camping outside my house just to make sure I’m not a terrorist. BUT after all that I can still get one? Fuck that, it’s too easy!! ban those devil silencers right now! I propose a March of Silence! Luckily our company makes it super simple. We set you up with a free NFA gun trust, do all your finger prints and photos required by the ATF at the gun show. After 10 min you are all done and we take care of the rest!Can you tell me what state you are in? Michigan here, I would come to a show to say hi, and talk gun trusts.Soooo. Hypothetically speaking. If someone were to go hunting a certain upland game type bird in South Dakota and that person was from out of state, could that person use your service?Yes, we could do all the required work to make the ATF happy and then once your suppressor is approved we could transfer it to you through an FFL in your state I'm just teasing, pede. Sounds like you make the terrible NFA process about as easy as it can be. Keep up the good work! MAGAIf I'm limited to 10 rounds I'm going to make sure my AR can blow a person in half or punch through a car door. When Chicago bulldozed Cabrini–Green many of the people were moved to all sections of the suburbs.I bought one in January, but then I remembered two scoops, two walls, etc. So I bought a second suppressor.Easy to buy...

Thinking a silencer on some rocks would really stop school shooters. Yes sir! That’s Barrett’s QDL suppressor for the M107A1. That brings it all the way down to hearing safe..That is incredible. I would still wear ears just because but still wow. The military would love you lol.That's just silly!  It's hard to really tell on video, but it certainly sounds almost like my suppressed .22.

I shot a suppressed AR this fall hunting prairie dogs.  It’s still loud AF but you don’t need hearing protection. Need to be able to hear your hunting party and the movement of your prey.

Hey OP, a bit off topic, but do you know if there is a legal way I can buy and own an ar-15 without there being any record of it?  I don’t want big brother to know I have it when/if these America-hating leftists ever come to take our guns.The only drawback is once you make the lower you're stuck with it. You even have to specify in your will who the parts of the rifle will be passed on to and to take the receiver to the police for legal disposal.California recently passed a law that basically requires when you make a lower receiver you have to add a serial number and register it.The only drawback is once you make the lower you're stuck with it.

Jokes on them, though. I've taken a peek in the back of the book. It doesn't go so well for them.

Canada would be a better destination for America’s liberal mental disorder since their leader would welcome them on his knees with his mouth open.In all seriousness though, Canada has a major aging population crisis on its hands. The average age went over 50yo, there are more people aged over 75 and under 25. There are 35 million people, compare that to Cali's 39 millions or France's 68 millions, over very smaller land areas.Because Mexicans especially doesn’t want them.

What does that have to do with my local school board? Supreme Court? Anyone?Sure, but to deny the fact that Western Civilization was born from Judeo-Christian morality and ethics is ludicrous.Whether you believe in God or not, the ethics, morals, and values found within Christianity are paramount to our civilization continuing and prospering.Sure, but that's not to say Judea-Christian morals aren't flawed, and don't have as much of a role in society as they did before.Besides, many of our founding fathers were atheist. My point is our country wasn't founded with Christianity in mind and to say so goes completely agasint the first sentence in the bill of rights.That's not true at all. Separation of church and state has nothing to do with what you're talking about. That separation simply means that there can be no state sponsored religion.Our country was created by taking the ethics and morals of Christianity and prescribing them into law. And most of the founders were practicing Christians, with a few of them being deists, and very few actual atheists.I’m also an atheist, but you’re wrong on this. There’s a difference between separation of church and state and separation of religion and society.Our country wasn't founded with christianity in mind? Are you joking? God is referenced in almost everything, it's in the pledge of allegiance! It wasnt added to the pledge of allegiance until the 50s. It wasnt on our money either; it was to separate us from the godless commies.You know nothing of the framers of our country. Back to the books for you. Seriously and with all respect, your inability to repent is wrecking havoc on your ability to look at this subject objectively. Your only seeing the tiny tiny tiny fragments that fit what your looking to see.In God We Trust is on our money.  They weren't atheists,  either.  This is incorrect.  They were Deists and Christians. Unless Eisenhower was a founding father, you're wrong. It was added in the 50s to seperate us from Soviets during the height of the cold war.So just what system do you know of that is perfect?  Our morals were given to us by our Creator, which in my book is as good as it gets.God and religion are not the same thing.  Religion is an institution corrupted by man.  God by definition is all that is good (incorruptible).  God is love.What is Judeo-Christianity? I know what Christianity is and I know what Judaism is but what is Judeo-Christianity? Do Jews really recognize Jesus as the Son of God and the Saviour of mankind?It's not a separate religion or anything, it's just a term for the Jewish / Christian god and the similarities those religions have.Your statement is vague and uncompelling.  What IS important is to restore the values that built this great nation.  We trust in GOD, and we will defend this right to the death - with our guns, pitchforks or whatever weapons at our disposal. "Congress shall pass no law respecting establishment of  religion." What does that have to do with my local school board? Supreme Court? Anyone?Sure, but to deny the fact that Western Civilization was born from Judeo-Christian morality and ethics is ludicrous.Whether you believe in God or not, the ethics, morals, and values found within Christianity are paramount to our civilization continuing and prospering.Sure, but that's not to say Judea-Christian morals aren't flawed, and don't have as much of a role in society as they did before.Besides, many of our founding fathers were atheist. My point is our country wasn't founded with Christianity in mind and to say so goes completely agasint the first sentence in the bill of rights.That's not true at all. Separation of church and state has nothing to do with what you're talking about. That separation simply means that there can be no state sponsored religion.Our country was created by taking the ethics and morals of Christianity and prescribing them into law. And most of the founders were practicing Christians, with a few of them being deists, and very few actual atheists.I’m also an atheist, but you’re wrong on this. There’s a difference between separation of church and state and separation of religion and society.Our country wasn't founded with christianity in mind? Are you joking? God is referenced in almost everything, it's in the pledge of allegiance! It wasnt added to the pledge of allegiance until the 50s. It wasnt on our money either; it was to separate us from the godless commies.You know nothing of the framers of our country. Back to the books for you. Seriously and with all respect, your inability to repent is wrecking havoc on your ability to look at this subject objectively. Your only seeing the tiny tiny tiny fragments that fit what your looking to see.In God We Trust is on our money.  They weren't atheists,  either.  This is incorrect.  They were Deists and Christians. Unless Eisenhower was a founding father, you're wrong. It was added in the 50s to seperate us from Soviets during the height of the cold war.So just what system do you know of that is perfect?  Our morals were given to us by our Creator, which in my book is as good as it gets.God and religion are not the same thing.  Religion is an institution corrupted by man.

What IS important is to restore the values that built this great nation.  We trust in GOD, and we will defend this right to the death - with our guns, pitchforks or whatever weapons at our disposal. if this is true (and i believe it is) we should have alerted like we are now about guns, back when they were getting God and the Bible out of schools and public discourse Everyone was and is today!! We WANT God in our schools, its the God damned commies who keep trying to eliminate any and al references of God. Why? Because the very foundation of our society says that we have HUMAN RIGHTS, GRANTED TO IS BY GOD. Commies, Liberals, Democrats .. whatever you choose to call them, they are all one and the same,  they must cleanse our society of any knowledge that there is no superior government here. Our Rights are granted to us by our God as defined and recognized in our Christian Faith and the founding documents of our Nation. Jesus told us that our human rights, all human rights are granted to mankind by God. Why should we not teach kids about how our country was founded? You don't have to force them to believe or present it as fact, but it's incredibly important to understand the foundation which this country was built on. you're completely incorrect - we can only have freedom because of God and God's Truth ------ have you ever read George Washington's inaugural addresses? or ANYthing from the founding fathers? they talk about God all the time ----- THAT is what set this country on the path to being the greatest nation on this planet in all of history ------ tyrants want to do TWO THINGS in order to subjugate a free people.. take away their Bible and take away their guns "The United states is not a Christian nation anymore than it is a jewish or Mohammedan nation" - John adams - this quote is an article of a treaty that was unanimously ratified by the Senate so your kinda just super wrongEveryone was and is today!!

The ideas, values, ethics, and morals our country was founded on came directly from Christianity. This is self-evident in the founding documents and supporting articles and letters between the founders.Originally came over for religious freedoms. From Holland first. One religion ruled in many of these countries. Actually this picture is probably more relevant for today in a way.Eugh your personality is so gross man, no one gives a shit that you're an atheist and no one wants your opinion on god. Stop embarrassing yourself. Don't bother. The prayer warriors are over here defending a being that gives cancer to kids and picks other ways to let his beloved creations suffer while screaming love me or burn for all eternity. If there is a god and he's our father, someone needs to call DHS on him.Don't bother.

That’s awesome man. Cherish the moment he will be one of the best VPs ever. Not once has he wavered on POTUS. And I love how he kept telling Tim Kaine during the debate that he’d go to bat for potus anytime any day. Good shit man.  He really does!

Good shit man.  His face is like “I’m not quite sure what’s going on but I like the enthusiasm of this young person so I’ll go with it.” Pence was our congressman in the Indiana 6th. I met him several times before he was even running for Governor. Fantastic human being. Imagine, you take one of the most thankless jobs in the world only to get harassed, threatened w/ death & slandered by the media & random psychos. That’s the privlege you earn after living your life of a saint, full on hatred from 1/3 the country...That’s so true. He’s the epitome of class and integrity and people treat him like dirt. I thanked him for just that and told him he has our respect and prayers even if the media doesn’t show it. That’s so true. He’s the epitome of class and integrity and people treat him like dirt. I thanked him for just that and told him he has our respect and prayers even if the media doesn’t show it. I got to see his motorcade when I just got into town. So amazing. I’ve never had the pleasure to see a POTUS or VP motorcade before. Oh yes there was a little group outside holding up a “Drive Out Trump Pence” Sign. It was so sad, those poor little darlings... I was going to buy some Pelegrino bottles from the hotel bar but they all got bored before the speech was over. Oh yes there was a little group outside holding up a “Drive Out Trump Pence” Sign.

It's a reference to the alpha male protagonist body guard of Johnny Quest. It was an adventure cartoon series from years back. Vice President Pence looks just like him.Ohhhh right! I’ve seen those memes but I just didn’t know where they were from or what the reference was. Thanks man!It's a reference to the alpha male protagonist body guard of Johnny Quest.

Just don't do anything gay around him or you'll end up with 120 volts to the nads. Damn, I love this guy. LoLI actually have no idea. My father has donated to the campaign and he just called me the day before asking if I wanted to meet Pence at the Leows Hotel. I was like hell yes lol!I actually have no idea. My father has donated to the campaign and he just called me the day before asking if I wanted to meet Pence at the Leows Hotel. I was like hell yes lol!He truly is a bad ass. Maybe he could throat punch one of the protesters outside. Little punk bitches. He truly is a bad ass. Maybe he could throat punch one of the protesters outside. Little punk bitches. As someone with probably the best gaydar of all time, Uncle Mike is definitely straight. When I met him my gaydar was saying 100% straight. Believe me.Sounds like a nice Tweet. No one would attack our POTUS when he's giving his condolences to victims of terrorism.Hannipede's opening monologue yesterday was one for the ages. Completely ripped fake news CNN, ABC, NBC, and CBS limb from limb on Bill Clinton's scandal coverage verses Stormy Daniels coverage.Dicking bimbos before he was president is somehow equivalent to raping your 20 year old intern in the oval office.Dicking bimbos before he was president is somehow equivalent to raping your 20 year old intern in the oval office.It was something to the effect of:  "I cannot believe we have a President who sleeps with porn stars and wants a space army, and I'm supposed to hate him"Cernovich and Coulter keep saying impeachment is coming too. Sick of these fake supporters. Trump will never be impeached. What? So Cernovich AND Coulter have completely jumped off the train? I'm disappointed but we don't need them.Coulter looking for attention and ragging on Trump gets bee crazy amounts of engagement. Cernovich was never maga. He was a cuck looking for a way to make money and sell his books, so he wrote about Trump when others weren't and used that gain some cred in the communityI think they're saying Dems are going to impeach when they take control back. There's little reason to think they won't if they have the power to.Dems will go straight for impeachment but Trump will not resign if he was impeached. Just look at slick willieImpeached and removal from office are separate things. House votes for impeachment, then senate votes to remove from office. I hate to say it but Trump’s chances of being impeached raised ten fold yesterday when he signed that OmniBust bill. I don’t think there’s a snowballs chance in hell we hold the house at midterms now, but we’ll definitely hold the senate. The first thing the New Democrat House will do in Jan 2019 is vote for impeachment, and there’s a good chance it will pass. Republican senate won’t vote to remove though (the republican senate didn’t even remove Clinton); and then it will probably strengthen his reelection, the same way it did for Clinton in the 90s. To be clear, I hope none of that happens (except his re-election of course) but after yesterday I feel the chances are high. He did it so there wasn't a shutdown on him. The other one was undeniably the Democrats' fault and it's so undeniable that you don't even hear any of Trump's haters mention it because they'd look stupid. Trump signed the bill, which disappointed me too, but he made it clear he will never sign a bill like this again and is asking for a line-item veto. Fighting the bill would have most likely led to more problems. Signing this and then warning that this bullshit isn't going to happen again shows that he's willing to keep our government intact, and pushed to give him line-item veto power, which guts Democrats' pork power. Also, he made it sound like he got something he wanted by getting extra military funding, and he was able to make the left look bad for ignoring DACA. If they try to pass any DACA with strings attached, he'll be able to cut the strings next time.There has to be a crime committed for impeachment to even be a matter. They can dream all they want, but they are stuck with Trump until January 20, 2025, that's the truth of it. We put up with Backdoor Barry for eight years, tough shits to them I say.Fat chance, when all they're focused on is fucking Stormy Daniels. Oh, maybe he did something shady about paying her to shut up? Yeah, try to impeach him for doing something wrong over a decade ago. I beg you, Democrats, please try to do that. They're focused on affairs he had long before he ran for President. Sad!They will, no doubt. I don’t think there’s a chance in hell we hold the House in midterms after yesterday. I think that in her mind, she has the ability to feign outrage to manipulate Trump's reactions. It makes more sense in that context.I used to like her, but now she’s going on and off the train too much. I think she is waiting for “impeachment” to be a self fulfilling prophecy. Coulter always struck me as trying to shock for the sake of being shocking. Just made the right look bad in the long term. Especially when fans went on about how "hot" she is. Not attractive.Yeah Cernovich clearly is a fake supporter just to make money off his following. Sad! Coulter is just too far right..shes no better than the far lefties.I can't align myself with anybody who uses no less than three different "-pill" terminology. When you sound like somebody from the rape-glorifying Incel community, it's time to jump ship.I honestly believe they are controlled opposition. No one who flip flops that much is an ally. They're used to try and flip anyone who is on the fence. Ann Coulter is too much of an ideological purist.
The problem is that what she fails to understand that Donald Trump is still human and he isn't perfect. He's not Superman where he can do anything. He has his flaws and drawbacks which are just part of being human after all and that's something that Ann Coulter has to accept.It's disappointing, especially from Coulter who wrote Adios America and was firmly in Trump's corner earlier on.  Remember the freak-out with the leak about Syria and 125K troops on the ground?  Do people not learn?It's especially ironic with Coulter considering there is a huge loophole available to the POTUS to start building the Wall right away.  Wasn't that a thing she was concerned with?  Hypocrites and fair-weather supporters...Fight back. Report them for being insensitive/offensive or whatever.. Use their tactics against them? But it will put that data into some sort of archive and could potentially be used against them. If we don't send the data we can't use it against them..

When you sound like somebody from the rape-glorifying Incel community, it's time to jump ship.Coulter looking for attention and ragging on Trump gets bee crazy amounts of engagement. Cernovich was never maga. He was a cuck looking for a way to make money and sell his books, so he wrote about Trump when others weren't and used that gain some cred in the communityI think they're saying Dems are going to impeach when they take control back. There's little reason to think they won't if they have the power to.Dems will go straight for impeachment but Trump will not resign if he was impeached. Just look at slick willieImpeached and removal from office are separate things. House votes for impeachment, then senate votes to remove from office. I hate to say it but Trump’s chances of being impeached raised ten fold yesterday when he signed that OmniBust bill. I don’t think there’s a snowballs chance in hell we hold the house at midterms now, but we’ll definitely hold the senate. The first thing the New Democrat House will do in Jan 2019 is vote for impeachment, and there’s a good chance it will pass. Republican senate won’t vote to remove though (the republican senate didn’t even remove Clinton); and then it will probably strengthen his reelection, the same way it did for Clinton in the 90s. To be clear, I hope none of that happens (except his re-election of course) but after yesterday I feel the chances are high. He did it so there wasn't a shutdown on him. The other one was undeniably the Democrats' fault and it's so undeniable that you don't even hear any of Trump's haters mention it because they'd look stupid. Trump signed the bill, which disappointed me too, but he made it clear he will never sign a bill like this again and is asking for a line-item veto. Fighting the bill would have most likely led to more problems. Signing this and then warning that this bullshit isn't going to happen again shows that he's willing to keep our government intact, and pushed to give him line-item veto power, which guts Democrats' pork power. Also, he made it sound like he got something he wanted by getting extra military funding, and he was able to make the left look bad for ignoring DACA. If they try to pass any DACA with strings attached, he'll be able to cut the strings next time.There has to be a crime committed for impeachment to even be a matter. They can dream all they want, but they are stuck with Trump until January 20, 2025, that's the truth of it. We put up with Backdoor Barry for eight years, tough shits to them I say.Fat chance, when all they're focused on is fucking Stormy Daniels. Oh, maybe he did something shady about paying her to shut up? Yeah, try to impeach him for doing something wrong over a decade ago. I beg you, Democrats, please try to do that. They're focused on affairs he had long before he ran for President. Sad!They will, no doubt. I don’t think there’s a chance in hell we hold the House in midterms after yesterday.

They're used to try and flip anyone who is on the fence. Ann Coulter is too much of an ideological purist.
The problem is that what she fails to understand that Donald Trump is still human and he isn't perfect. He's not Superman where he can do anything. He has his flaws and drawbacks which are just part of being human after all and that's something that Ann Coulter has to accept.Fight back. Report them for being insensitive/offensive or whatever..

How many people are finding out there was a terrorist attack in France yesterday just because Trump just tweeted it now. Millions? Meanwhile Portland is shut down with people protesting the second amendment and screeching about the NRA. I had an appointment to have some auto work done and couldn’t get past the protestors. Guess they don’t need my business. Sitting in the waiting room of an auto shop in the next town over. The day before yesterday my mom asked me if I'm ever going back to Paris and I said not until France gets their terrorist attack/radical problem under control. And what do you know.... another attack!My mom is going to Paris for 2-3 weeks but she says she's scared of terrorists. She's also a huge Trump hater. Deep down they know their libtard policies are just for virtue signaling. I hope she is ok. The day after we went to the Louvre a man from the religion of peace was waving a machete at a bunch of tourists there and I think cut a security guard. It was definitely weird seeing so much military around with assault weapons but I guess that's just how it is now.Yea I don't know how safe I'd feel going to UK France or Germany right now. Might look to travel in South America or Asia instead.And he sets a record with Macron, putting him in front of his responsibility, because that's where the future of Europe will be determined. 3D chessThe future of Europe will be decided in France. Trump set the precedent to put Macron in front of his fate. If shit goes ugly, he'll be reminding little Macron.https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/86pdci/today_a_french_police_officer_died_after_swapping/Meanwhile Portland is shut down with people protesting the second amendment and screeching about the NRA.

After all isn't insanity doing the same over and over and expecting different results?I understand the feeling, please keep in mind that not all of us french were fooled by Macron's Hope and Change communication.We had one candidate, Fillon, whose agenda was closest to Trump's (fight radical islam, control our border and immigration, lower taxes, address our debt problem).  Le Pen is rightwing for borders, but socially a spendy leftist.Fillon started as favorite, and was politically assassinated by what looks like collusion between the previous government, the justice system, and the media.  He was indicted during the campaing for hiring his wife as an assistant when he was a Representative, which was entirely legal and which many were still doing at the time.  It's been over a year and, like the Mueller probe, nothing has come out of it because there is no crime.Too many people were swayed by the media (no alt-media here, and we're a backward country where the Internet has a smaller impact) or simply refused to face the big issues and tough decisions that were needed.

Venise, right now, must be really great.This is our european heritage, but also a magnificent gift to the civilized world. Two reasons to protect and enjoy it !How do you say Ships full of cargo containers chock full of Mohammedans heading to Saudi Arabia in French?What's the significance of Trump saying this to Macron?  I want to believe Macron is becoming redpilled, and GEOTUS is offering to help him get through it.Didn't he do a lot of what Trump wanted when they met? I kept reading he wasn't as left wing as MSM wanted him to be.I don't know what he does to all the cucked american institutes of influence though. Hope he drains those swamps as well.Trump knows Macron will be a great guy if his balls are squeezed hard enough. 
He is setting the date, upping the ante, and signaling it to him.Didn't he do a lot of what Trump wanted when they met?

He is setting the date, upping the ante, and signaling it to him.Macron must be on cloud nine. He’s never be comforted and supported by anyone as young as Donald Trump. Is it me or does it seem that Trump has an underlying message of France loss of their country to Muslim Invaders?I liked it better when Trump was willing to say, 'Islamic Terrorists!' France is lost and in no small part because of the  cultural diversity supported by Macron. I'm a Trump supporter and I support the French people and their culture not, Macron and his willingness to be diverse at the expense of his countrymen.As much as I love Trump, and correct me if I'm wrong, did he ever tweet about the victims in Austin? As crazy as the entite situation was, he should have said something.Macron is probably giddy that his bestie from the international conference said he was with him. Already making plans to follow Trump like a puppy at their next playdate.why are you here? you should celebrate Macron wanting to emulate Trump. That is a step closer to Removing Kebab and ending this madness.I'm here because I support Trump and only visit the Donald on Reddit so shove off with your preconcieved notions. 
The reason why I'm not fond of Macron's over-eagerness for Trump is because I don't trust it's genuine. Macron was all gung-ho for Merkle at the start and he suddenly started kissing the ground Trump walks on? I don't buy it. I think Macron doesn't really care much for Trump or the movement that pushes people like Trump into places of influence (Farage and LePen for example). I do, however, believe he wants that influence and power for his own political purposes. I don't believe Macron is sold on liberty. I believe he's playing the game to win affections and soar higher so he can do as he pleases. French pede here.  Macron is a globalist (against border control, for refugees paid for by our tax euros), a socialist (more taxes across the board, more regulations), and he is soft on radical islam (doing nothing to control it).I'm nearly 40, been self-employed for a decade writing software in a variety of areas.  I understand software and hardware in depth and I have a few projects I am proud of.  A few academic papers.Why am I not madly applying for a job?  Still need to convince myself that I could handle it, I suppose.You're right, it is an uncomfortable situation for poor Macron. Trump might also have something to do with SA's recent move away from radical islam, which helps immensely.  It's a big game.Macron will say anything and its contrary, relying on people to hear only the part they like, with full support from the MSM.  It worked very well to get him elected.My characterization is based on what actually happens: the laws supported by his government and voted by his party.  He deceived a lot of the people who voted for him (especially the elderly, farmers, small businesses) and his popularity is falling (now 40%, down from 52% in december).Yes, something like that, except he openly said he's a socialist.  He also said he's not a socialist.  And that he's a maoist.Macron has some Trump-like skills, perhaps that's why he appeals to some Trump supporters.  I'm sure Macron has shills on T_D to make himself popular with Trump's base, it's good leverage on Trump.That's hostile.  He's joking about Macron's behavior when Trump is around, no need to try to boot someone out of this sub.Thank you! I'm not going anywhere, though.

This is just to distinguish between oxygenated and deoxygenated blood for demonstrative purposes. In fact, all blood is red. Oxygenated blood is a brighter red while deoxygenated blood is a darker red color.

We must continue to destroy the terrorists. Hundreds of people downvoted this. Just think about that. Hundreds would rather hate Trump than wish a country well during a tragedy. France is not our country. What would you like Trump to do? Get involved? No, France is its own sovereign nation reaping the consequences of their decisions and beliefs. So the best we can do  when shit like this happens is send condolences.Nah I would rather France do something. These messages just happen nearly weekly and have lost all meaning to me. That's what Trump is inducing, by sending a seemingly kind message, and in reality put the nose of that shithead where it belongs, all with a smile.Nah I would rather France do something.

I love(d) Trump but he's seriously starting to lose a LOT of his base because of his horrible appointments.
It seems obvious to me that he's been compromised because instead of draining the swamp he seems to keep filling it.
Bolton? WTF?
 Bolton is a psychopath and an all out war-monger.Actually want agree with you completely but I know a few friends that are actually really fucking awesome people and Hate what the EU is done to themActually want agree with you completely but I know a few friends that are actually really fucking awesome people and Hate what the EU is done to themI am also surprised he does not mention islamist outright. He is going softer on Macron, but the direction is clear.
